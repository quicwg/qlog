                      Main logging schema for qlog
                draft-ietf-quic-qlog-main-schema-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a high-level schema for a standardized
   logging format called qlog.  This format allows easy sharing of data
   and the creation of reusable visualization and debugging tools.  The
   high-level schema in this document is intended to be protocol-
   agnostic.  Separate documents specify how the format should be used
   for specific protocol data.  The schema is also format-agnostic, and
   can be represented in for example JSON, csv or protobuf.

1.  Introduction

   There is currently a lack of an easily usable, standardized endpoint
   logging format.  Especially for the use case of debugging and
   evaluating modern Web protocols and their performance, it is often
   difficult to obtain structured logs that provide adequate information
   for tasks like problem root cause analysis.

   This document aims to provide a high-level schema and harness that
   describes the general layout of an easily usable, shareable,
   aggregatable and structured logging format.  This high-level schema
   is protocol agnostic, with logging entries for specific protocols and
   use cases being defined in other documents (see for example
   [QLOG-QUIC] for QUIC and [QLOG-H3] for HTTP/3 and QPACK-related event
   definitions).

   The goal of this high-level schema is to provide amenities and
   default characteristics that each logging file should contain (or
   should be able to contain), such that generic and reusable toolsets
   can be created that can deal with logs from a variety of different
   protocols and use cases.

   As such, this document contains concepts such as versioning, metadata
   inclusion, log aggregation, event grouping and log file size
   reduction techniques.

   The qlog schema can be serialized in many ways (e.g., JSON, CBOR,
   protobuf, etc).  This document describes only how to employ [JSON],
   its subset [I-JSON], and its streamable derivative
   [JSON-Text-Sequences].

      Note to RFC editor: Please remove the follow paragraphs in this
      section before publication.

   (https://github.com/quicwg/qlog).  Readers are advised to refer to
   the "editor's draft" at that URL for an up-to-date version of this
   document.

   Concrete examples of integrations of this schema in various
   programming languages can be found at https://github.com/quiclog/
   qlog/ (https://github.com/quiclog/qlog/).

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.1.1.  Schema definition

   To define events and data structures, all qlog documents use the
   Concise Data Definition Language [CDDL].  This document uses the
   basic syntax, the specific text, uint, float32, float64, bool, and
   any types, as well as the .default, .size, and .regexp control
   operators, the ~ unwrapping operator, and the $ extension point
   syntax from [CDDL].

   Additionally, this document defines the following custom types for
   clarity:

   ; CDDL's uint is defined as being 64-bit in size
   ; but for many protocol fields we want to be more restrictive
   ; and explicit
   uint8 = uint .size 1
   uint16 = uint .size 2
   uint32 = uint .size 4
   uint64 = uint .size 8

   ; an even-length lowercase string of hexadecimally encoded bytes
   ; examples: 82dc, 027339, 4cdbfd9bf0
   ; this is needed because the default CDDL binary string (bytes/bstr)
   ; is only CBOR and not JSON compatible
   hexstring = text .regexp "([0-9a-f]{2})*"

                 Figure 1: Additional CDDL type definitions

   All timestamps and time-related values (e.g., offsets) in qlog are
   logged as float64 in the millisecond resolution.

   Other qlog documents can define their own CDDL-compatible (struct)
   types (e.g., separately for each Packet type that a protocol
   supports).

      Note to RFC editor: Please remove the following text in this
      section before publication.

   The main general CDDL syntax conventions in this document a reader
   should be aware of for easy reading comprehension are:

   *  ? obj : this object is optional

   *  TypeName1 / TypeName2 : a union of these two types (object can be
      either type 1 OR type 2)

   *  obj: TypeName : this object has this concrete type

   *  obj: [* TypeName] : this object is an array of this type with
      minimum size of 0 elements

   *  obj: [+ TypeName] : this object is an array of this type with
      minimum size of 1 element

   *  TypeName = ... : defines a new type

   *  EnumName = "entry1" / "entry2" / entry3 / ...: defines an enum

   *  StructName = { ... } : defines a new struct type

   *  ; : single-line comment

   *  * text => any : special syntax to indicate 0 or more fields that
      have a string key that maps to any value.  Used to indicate a
      generic JSON object.

   All timestamps and time-related values (e.g., offsets) in qlog are
   logged as float64 in the millisecond resolution.

   Other qlog documents can define their own CDDL-compatible (struct)
   types (e.g., separately for each Packet type that a protocol
   supports).

1.1.2.  Serialization examples

   Serialization examples in this document use JSON ([JSON]) unless
   otherwise indicated.

2.  Design goals

   The main tenets for the qlog schema design are:

   *  Streamable, event-based logging

   *  A flexible format that can reduce log producer overhead, at the
      cost of increased complexity for consumers (e.g. tools)

   *  Extensible and pragmatic

   *  Aggregation and transformation friendly (e.g., the top-level
      element for the non-streaming format is a container for individual
      traces, group_ids can be used to tag events to a particular
      context)

   *  Metadata is stored together with event data

3.  The high level qlog schema

   A qlog file should be able to contain several individual traces and
   logs from multiple vantage points that are in some way related.  To
   that end, the top-level element in the qlog schema defines only a
   small set of "header" fields and an array of component traces.  For
   this document, the required "qlog_version" field MUST have a value of
   "0.3".

   Note:  there have been several previously broadly deployed qlog
      versions based on older drafts of this document (see draft-marx-
      qlog-main-schema).  The old values for the "qlog_version" field
      were "draft-00", "draft-01" and "draft-02".  When qlog was moved
      to the QUIC working group, we decided to switch to a new
      versioning scheme which is independent of individual draft
      document numbers.  However, we did start from 0.3, as conceptually
      0.0, 0.1 and 0.2 can map to draft-00, draft-01 and draft-02.

   As qlog can be serialized in a variety of ways, the "qlog_format"
   field is used to indicate which serialization option was chosen.  Its
   value MUST either be one of the options defined in this document
   (e.g., Section 6) or the field must be omitted entirely, in which
   case it assumes the default value of "JSON".

   In order to make it easier to parse and identify qlog files and their
   serialization format, the "qlog_version" and "qlog_format" fields and
   their values SHOULD be in the first 256 characters/bytes of the
   resulting log file.

   An example of the qlog file's top-level structure is shown in
   Figure 2.

   Definition:

   QlogFile = {
       qlog_version: text
       ? qlog_format: text .default "JSON"
       ? title: text
       ? description: text
       ? summary: Summary
       ? traces: [+ Trace / TraceError]
   }

                       Figure 2: QlogFile definition

   JSON serialization example:

   {
       "qlog_version": "0.3",
       "qlog_format": "JSON",
       "title": "Name of this particular qlog file (short)",
       "description": "Description for this group of traces (long)",
       "summary": {
           ...
       },
       "traces": [...]
   }

                         Figure 3: QlogFile example

3.1.  Summary

   In a real-life deployment with a large amount of generated logs, it
   can be useful to sort and filter logs based on some basic summarized
   or aggregated data (e.g., log length, packet loss rate, log location,
   presence of error events, ...).  The summary field (if present)
   SHOULD be on top of the qlog file, as this allows for the file to be
   processed in a streaming fashion (i.e., the implementation could just
   read up to and including the summary field and then only load the
   full logs that are deemed interesting by the user).

   As the summary field is highly deployment-specific, this document
   does not specify any default fields or their semantics.  Some
   examples of potential entries are shown in Section 3.1.

   Definition:

   Summary = {
       ; summary can contain any type of custom information
       ; text here doesn't mean the type text,
       ; but the fact that keys/names in the objects are strings
       * text => any
   }

                        Figure 4: Summary definition

   JSON serialization example:

   {
       "trace_count": 1,
       "max_duration": 5006,
       "max_outgoing_loss_rate": 0.013,
       "total_event_count": 568,
       "error_count": 2
   }

                         Figure 5: Summary example

3.2.  traces

   It is often advantageous to group several related qlog traces
   together in a single file.  For example, we can simultaneously
   perform logging on the client, on the server and on a single point on
   their common network path.  For analysis, it is useful to aggregate
   these three individual traces together into a single file, so it can
   be uniquely stored, transferred and annotated.

   As such, the "traces" array contains a list of individual qlog
   traces.  Typical qlogs will only contain a single trace in this
   array.  These can later be combined into a single qlog file by taking
   the "traces" entry/entries for each qlog file individually and
   copying them to the "traces" array of a new, aggregated qlog file.
   This is typically done in a post-processing step.

   The "traces" array can thus contain both normal traces (for the
   definition of the Trace type, see Section 3.3), but also "error"
   entries.  These indicate that we tried to find/convert a file for
   inclusion in the aggregated qlog, but there was an error during the
   process.  Rather than silently dropping the erroneous file, we can
   opt to explicitly include it in the qlog file as an entry in the
   "traces" array, as shown in Figure 6.

   Definition:

   TraceError = {
       error_description: text
       ; the original URI at which we attempted to find the file
       ? uri: text
       ? vantage_point: VantagePoint
   }

                      Figure 6: TraceError definition

   JSON serialization example:

   {
       "error_description": "File could not be found",
       "uri": "/srv/traces/today/latest.qlog",
       "vantage_point": { type: "server" }
   }

                        Figure 7: TraceError example

   Note that another way to combine events of different traces in a
   single qlog file is through the use of the "group_id" field,
   discussed in Section 3.4.6.

3.3.  Individual Trace containers

   The exact conceptual definition of a Trace can be fluid.  For
   example, a trace could contain all events for a single connection,
   for a single endpoint, for a single measurement interval, for a
   single protocol, etc.  As such, a Trace container contains some
   metadata in addition to the logged events, see Figure 8.

   In the normal use case however, a trace is a log of a single data
   flow collected at a single location or vantage point.  For example,
   for QUIC, a single trace only contains events for a single logical
   QUIC connection for either the client or the server.

   The semantics and context of the trace can mainly be deduced from the
   entries in the "common_fields" list and "vantage_point" field.

   Definition:

   Trace = {
       ? title: text
       ? description: text
       ? configuration: Configuration
       ? common_fields: CommonFields
       ? vantage_point: VantagePoint
       events: [* Event]
   }

                         Figure 8: Trace definition

   JSON serialization example:

   {
       "title": "Name of this particular trace (short)",
       "description": "Description for this trace (long)",
       "configuration": {
           "time_offset": 150
       },
       "common_fields": {
           "ODCID": "abcde1234",
           "time_format": "absolute"
       },
       "vantage_point": {
           "name": "backend-67",
           "type": "server"
       },
       "events": [...]
   }

                          Figure 9: Trace example

3.3.1.  Configuration

   We take into account that a qlog file is usually not used in
   isolation, but by means of various tools.  Especially when
   aggregating various traces together or preparing traces for a
   demonstration, one might wish to persist certain tool-based settings
   inside the qlog file itself.  For this, the configuration field is
   used.

   The configuration field can be viewed as a generic metadata field
   that tools can fill with their own fields, based on per-tool logic.
   It is best practice for tools to prefix each added field with their
   tool name to prevent collisions across tools.  This document only
   defines two optional, standard, tool-independent configuration
   settings: "time_offset" and "original_uris".

   Definition:

   Configuration = {
       ; time_offset is in milliseconds
       time_offset: float64
       original_uris:[* text]
       * text => any
   }

                    Figure 10: Configuration definition

   JSON serialization example:

   {
       "time_offset": 150,
       "original_uris": [
           "https://example.org/trace1.qlog",
           "https://example.org/trace2.qlog"
       ]
   }

                      Figure 11: Configuration example

3.3.1.1.  time_offset

   The time_offset field indicates by how many milliseconds the starting
   time of the current trace should be offset.  This is useful when
   comparing logs taken from various systems, where clocks might not be
   perfectly synchronous.  Users could use manual tools or automated
   logic to align traces in time and the found optimal offsets can be
   stored in this field for future usage.  The default value is 0.

3.3.1.2.  original_uris

   The original_uris field is used when merging multiple individual qlog
   files or other source files (e.g., when converting .pcaps to qlog).
   It allows to keep better track where certain data came from.  It is a
   simple array of strings.  It is an array instead of a single string,
   since a single qlog trace can be made up out of an aggregation of
   multiple component qlog traces as well.  The default value is an
   empty array.

3.3.1.3.  custom fields

   Tools can add optional custom metadata to the "configuration" field
   to store state and make it easier to share specific data viewpoints
   and view configurations.

   Two examples from the qvis toolset (https://qvis.edm.uhasselt.be) are
   shown in Figure 12.

   {
       "configuration" : {
           "qvis" : {
               "congestion_graph": {
                   "startX": 1000,
                   "endX": 2000,
                   "focusOnEventIndex": 124
               }

               "sequence_diagram" : {
                   "focusOnEventIndex": 555
               }
           }
       }
   }

               Figure 12: Custom configuration fields example

3.3.2.  vantage_point

   The vantage_point field describes the vantage point from which the
   trace originates, see Figure 13.  Each trace can have only a single
   vantage_point and thus all events in a trace MUST BE from the
   perspective of this vantage_point.  To include events from multiple
   vantage_points, implementers can for example include multiple traces,
   split by vantage_point, in a single qlog file.

   Definitions:

   VantagePoint = {
       ? name: text
       type: VantagePointType
       ? flow: VantagePointType
   }

   ; client = endpoint which initiates the connection
   ; server = endpoint which accepts the connection
   ; network = observer in between client and server
   VantagePointType = "client" / "server" / "network" / "unknown"

                     Figure 13: VantagePoint definition

   JSON serialization examples:

   {
       "name": "aioquic client",
       "type": "client"
   }

   {
       "name": "wireshark trace",
       "type": "network",
       "flow": "client"
   }

                      Figure 14: VantagePoint example

   The flow field is only required if the type is "network" (for
   example, the trace is generated from a packet capture).  It is used
   to disambiguate events like "packet sent" and "packet received".
   This is indicated explicitly because for multiple reasons (e.g.,
   privacy) data from which the flow direction can be otherwise inferred
   (e.g., IP addresses) might not be present in the logs.

   Meaning of the different values for the flow field: * "client"
   indicates that this vantage point follows client data flow semantics
   (a "packet sent" event goes in the direction of the server).  *
   "server" indicates that this vantage point follow server data flow
   semantics (a "packet sent" event goes in the direction of the
   client).  * "unknown" indicates that the flow's direction is unknown.

   Depending on the context, tools confronted with "unknown" values in
   the vantage_point can either try to heuristically infer the semantics
   from protocol-level domain knowledge (e.g., in QUIC, the client
   always sends the first packet) or give the user the option to switch
   between client and server perspectives manually.

3.4.  Field name semantics

   Inside of the "events" field of a qlog trace is a list of events
   logged by the endpoint.  Each event is specified as a generic object
   with a number of member fields and their associated data.  Depending
   on the protocol and use case, the exact member field names and their
   formats can differ across implementations.  This section lists the
   main, pre-defined and reserved field names with specific semantics
   and expected corresponding value formats.

   Each qlog event at minimum requires the "time" (Section 3.4.1),
   "name" (Section 3.4.2) and "data" (Section 3.4.3) fields.  Other
   typical fields are "time_format" (Section 3.4.1), "protocol_type"
   (Section 3.4.4), "trigger" (Section 3.4.5), and "group_id"
   Section 3.4.6.  As especially these later fields typically have
   identical values across individual event instances, they are normally
   logged separately in the "common_fields" (Section 3.4.7).

   The specific values for each of these fields and their semantics are
   defined in separate documents, specific per protocol or use case.
   For example: event definitions for QUIC, HTTP/3 and QPACK can be
   found in [QLOG-QUIC] and [QLOG-H3].

   Other fields are explicitly allowed by the qlog approach, and tools
   SHOULD allow for the presence of unknown event fields, but their
   semantics depend on the context of the log usage (e.g., for QUIC, the
   ODCID field is used), see [QLOG-QUIC].

   An example of a qlog event with its component fields is shown in
   Figure 15.

   Definition:

   Event = {
       time: float64
       name: text
       data: $ProtocolEventBody

       ? time_format: TimeFormat

       ? protocol_type: ProtocolType
       ? group_id: GroupID

       ; events can contain any amount of custom fields
       * text => any
   }

       "group_id": "127ecc830d98f9d54a42c4f0842aa87e181a",

       "time_format": "absolute",

       "ODCID": "127ecc830d98f9d54a42c4f0842aa87e181a"
   }

                          Figure 16: Event example

3.4.1.  Timestamps

   The "time" field indicates the timestamp at which the event occurred.
   Its value is typically the Unix timestamp since the 1970 epoch
   (number of milliseconds since midnight UTC, January 1, 1970, ignoring
   leap seconds).  However, qlog supports two more succinct timestamps
   formats to allow reducing file size.  The employed format is
   indicated in the "time_format" field, which allows one of three
   values: "absolute", "delta" or "relative".

   Definition:

   TimeFormat = "absolute" / "delta" / "relative"

                      Figure 17: TimeFormat definition

   *  Absolute: Include the full absolute timestamp with each event.
      This approach uses the largest amount of characters.  This is also
      the default value of the "time_format" field.

   *  Delta: Delta-encode each time value on the previously logged
      value.  The first event in a trace typically logs the full
      absolute timestamp.  This approach uses the least amount of
      characters.

   *  Relative: Specify a full "reference_time" timestamp (typically
      this is done up-front in "common_fields", see Section 3.4.7) and
      include only relatively-encoded values based on this
      reference_time with each event.  The "reference_time" value is
      typically the first absolute timestamp.  This approach uses a
      medium amount of characters.

   The first option is good for stateless loggers, the second and third
   for stateful loggers.  The third option is generally preferred, since
   it produces smaller files while being easier to reason about.  An
   example for each option can be seen in Figure 18.

   The absolute approach will use:
   1500, 1505, 1522, 1588

   The delta approach will use:
   1500, 5, 17, 66

   The relative approach will:
   - set the reference_time to 1500 in "common_fields"
   - use: 0, 5, 22, 88

        Figure 18: Three different approaches for logging timestamps

   One of these options is typically chosen for the entire trace (put
   differently: each event has the same value for the "time_format"
   field).  Each event MUST include a timestamp in the "time" field.

   Events in each individual trace SHOULD be logged in strictly
   ascending timestamp order (though not necessarily absolute value, for
   the "delta" format).  Tools CAN sort all events on the timestamp
   before processing them, though are not required to (as this could
   impose a significant processing overhead).  This can be a problem
   especially for multi-threaded and/or streaming loggers, who could
   consider using a separate post-processor to order qlog events in time
   if a tool do not provide this feature.

   Timestamps do not have to use the UNIX epoch timestamp as their
   reference.  For example for privacy considerations, any initial
   reference timestamps (for example "endpoint uptime in ms" or "time
   since connection start in ms") can be chosen.  Tools SHOULD NOT
   assume the ability to derive the absolute Unix timestamp from qlog
   traces, nor allow on them to relatively order events across two or
   more separate traces (in this case, clock drift should also be taken
   into account).

3.4.2.  Category and Event Type

   Events differ mainly in the type of metadata associated with them.
   To help identify a given event and how to interpret its metadata in
   the "data" field (see Section 3.4.3), each event has an associated
   "name" field.  This can be considered as a concatenation of two other
   fields, namely event "category" and event "type".

   Category allows a higher-level grouping of events per specific event
   type.  For example for QUIC and HTTP/3, the different categories
   could be "transport", "http", "qpack", and "recovery".  Within these
   categories, the event Type provides additional granularity.  For
   example for QUIC and HTTP/3, within the "transport" Category, there
   would be "packet_sent" and "packet_received" events.

   Logging category and type separately conceptually allows for fast and
   high-level filtering based on category and the re-use of event types
   across categories.  However, it also considerably inflates the log
   size and this flexibility is not used extensively in practice at the
   time of writing.

   As such, the default approach in qlog is to concatenate both field
   values using the ":" character in the "name" field, as can be seen in
   Figure 19.  As such, qlog category and type names MUST NOT include
   this character.

   JSON serialization using separate fields:
   {
       "category": "transport",
       "type": "packet_sent"
   }

   JSON serialization using ":" concatenated field:
   {
       "name": "transport:packet_sent"
   }

      Figure 19: Ways of logging category, type and name of an event.

   Certain serializations CAN emit category and type as separate fields,
   and qlog tools SHOULD be able to deal with both the concatenated
   "name" field, and the separate "category" and "type" fields.  Text-
   based serializations however are encouraged to employ the
   concatenated "name" field for efficiency.

3.4.3.  Data

   The data field is a generic object.  It contains the per-event
   metadata and its form and semantics are defined per specific sort of
   event.  For example, data field value definitions for QUIC and HTTP/3
   can be found in [QLOG-QUIC] and [QLOG-H3].

   This field is defined here as a CDDL extension point (a "socket" or
   "plug") named $ProtocolEventBody.  Other documents MUST properly
   extend this extension point when defining new data field content
   options to enable automated validation of aggregated qlog schemas.

   The only common field defined for the data field is the trigger
   field, which is discussed in Section 3.4.5.

   Definition:

   ; The ProtocolEventBody is any key-value map (e.g., JSON object)
   ; only the optional trigger field is defined in this document
   $ProtocolEventBody /= {
       ? trigger: text
       * text => any
   }
   ; event documents are intended to extend this socket by using:
   ; NewProtocolEvents = EventType1 / EventType2 / ... / EventTypeN
   ; $ProtocolEventBody /= NewProtocolEvents

                  Figure 20: ProtocolEventBody definition

   One purely illustrative example for a QUIC "packet_sent" event is
   shown in Figure 21:

   TransportPacketSent = {
       ? packet_size: uint16
       header: PacketHeader
       ? frames:[* QuicFrame]
       ? trigger: "pto_probe" / "retransmit_timeout" / "bandwidth_probe"
   }

   could be serialized as

   {
       "packet_size": 1280,
       "header": {
           "packet_type": "1RTT",
           "packet_number": 123
       },
       "frames": [
           {
               "frame_type": "stream",
               "length": 1000,
               "offset": 456
           },
           {
               "frame_type": "padding"
           }
       ]
   }

    Figure 21: Example of the 'data' field for a QUIC packet_sent event

3.4.4.  protocol_type

   The "protocol_type" array field indicates to which protocols (or
   protocol "stacks") this event belongs.  This allows a single qlog
   file to aggregate traces of different protocols (e.g., a web server
   offering both TCP+HTTP/2 and QUIC+HTTP/3 connections).

   Definition:

   ProtocolType = [+ text]

                     Figure 22: ProtocolType definition

   For example, QUIC and HTTP/3 events have the "QUIC" and "HTTP3"
   protocol_type entry values, see [QLOG-QUIC] and [QLOG-H3].

   Typically however, all events in a single trace are of the same few
   protocols, and this array field is logged once in "common_fields",
   see Section 3.4.7.

3.4.5.  Triggers

   Sometimes, additional information is needed in the case where a
   single event can be caused by a variety of other events.  In the
   normal case, the context of the surrounding log messages gives a hint
   as to which of these other events was the cause.  However, in highly-
   parallel and optimized implementations, corresponding log messages
   might separated in time.  Another option is to explicitly indicate
   these "triggers" in a high-level way per-event to get more fine-
   grained information without much additional overhead.

   In qlog, the optional "trigger" field contains a string value
   describing the reason (if any) for this event instance occurring, see
   Section 3.4.3.  While this "trigger" field could be a property of the
   qlog Event itself, it is instead a property of the "data" field
   instead.  This choice was made because many event types do not
   include a trigger value, and having the field at the Event-level
   would cause overhead in some serializations.  Additional information
   on the trigger can be added in the form of additional member fields
   of the "data" field value, yet this is highly implementation-
   specific, as are the trigger field's string values.

   One purely illustrative example of some potential triggers for QUIC's
   "packet_dropped" event is shown in Figure 23:

   TransportPacketDropped = {
       ? packet_type: PacketType
       ? raw_length: uint16

       ? trigger: "key_unavailable" / "unknown_connection_id" /
                  "decrypt_error" / "unsupported_version"
   }

                         Figure 23: Trigger example

3.4.6.  group_id

   As discussed in Section 3.3, a single qlog file can contain several
   traces taken from different vantage points.  However, a single trace
   from one endpoint can also contain events from a variety of sources.
   For example, a server implementation might choose to log events for
   all incoming connections in a single large (streamed) qlog file.  As
   such, we need a method for splitting up events belonging to separate
   logical entities.

   The simplest way to perform this splitting is by associating a "group
   identifier" to each event that indicates to which conceptual "group"
   each event belongs.  A post-processing step can then extract events
   per group.  However, this group identifier can be highly protocol and
   context-specific.  In the example above, we might use QUIC's
   "Original Destination Connection ID" to uniquely identify a
   connection.  As such, they might add a "ODCID" field to each event.
   However, a middlebox logging IP or TCP traffic might rather use four-
   tuples to identify connections, and add a "four_tuple" field.

   As such, to provide consistency and ease of tooling in cross-protocol
   and cross-context setups, qlog instead defines the common "group_id"
   field, which contains a string value.  Implementations are free to
   use their preferred string serialization for this field, so long as
   it contains a unique value per logical group.  Some examples can be
   seen in Figure 25.

   Definition:

   GroupID = text

                       Figure 24: GroupID definition

   JSON serialization example for events grouped by four tuples and QUIC
   connection IDs:

   "events": [
       {
           "time": 1553986553579,
           "protocol_type": ["TCP", "TLS", "HTTP2"],
           "group_id": "ip1=2001:67c:1232:144:9498:6df6:f450:110b,
                      ip2=2001:67c:2b0:1c1::198,port1=59105,port2=80",
           "name": "transport:packet_received",
           "data": { ... }
       },
       {
           "time": 1553986553581,
           "protocol_type": ["QUIC","HTTP3"],
           "group_id": "127ecc830d98f9d54a42c4f0842aa87e181a",
           "name": "transport:packet_sent",
           "data": { ... }
       }
   ]

                         Figure 25: GroupID example

   Note that in some contexts (for example a Multipath transport
   protocol) it might make sense to add additional contextual per-event
   fields (for example "path_id"), rather than use the group_id field
   for that purpose.

   Note also that, typically, a single trace only contains events
   belonging to a single logical group (for example, an individual QUIC
   connection).  As such, instead of logging the "group_id" field with
   an identical value for each event instance, this field is typically
   logged once in "common_fields", see Section 3.4.7.

3.4.7.  common_fields

   As discussed in the previous sections, information for a typical qlog
   event varies in three main fields: "time", "name" and associated
   data.  Additionally, there are also several more advanced fields that
   allow mixing events from different protocols and contexts inside of
   the same trace (for example "protocol_type" and "group_id").  In most
   "normal" use cases however, the values of these advanced fields are
   consistent for each event instance (for example, a single trace
   contains events for a single QUIC connection).

   To reduce file size and making logging easier, qlog uses the
   "common_fields" list to indicate those fields and their values that
   are shared by all events in this component trace.  This prevents
   these fields from being logged for each individual event.  An example
   of this is shown in Figure 26.

   JSON serialization with repeated field values
   per-event instance:

   {
       "events": [{
               "group_id": "127ecc830d98f9d54a42c4f0842aa87e181a",
               "protocol_type": ["QUIC","HTTP3"],
               "time_format": "relative",
               "reference_time": 1553986553572,

               "time": 2,
               "name": "transport:packet_received",
               "data": { ... }
           },{
               "group_id": "127ecc830d98f9d54a42c4f0842aa87e181a",
               "protocol_type": ["QUIC","HTTP3"],

               "name": "http:frame_parsed",
               "data": { ... }
           }
       ]
   }

   JSON serialization with repeated field values instead
   extracted to common_fields:

       "common_fields": {
           "group_id": "127ecc830d98f9d54a42c4f0842aa87e181a",
           "protocol_type": ["QUIC","HTTP3"],
           "time_format": "relative",
           "reference_time": 1553986553572
       },
       "events": [
           {
               "time": 2,
               "name": "transport:packet_received",
               "data": { ... }
           },{
               "time": 7,
               "name": "http:frame_parsed",
               "data": { ... }
           }
       ]
   }

                      Figure 26: CommonFields example

   The "common_fields" field is a generic dictionary of key-value pairs,
   where the key is always a string and the value can be of any type,
   but is typically also a string or number.  As such, unknown entries
   in this dictionary MUST be disregarded by the user and tools (i.e.,
   the presence of an unknown field is explicitly NOT an error).

   The list of default qlog fields that are typically logged in
   common_fields (as opposed to as individual fields per event instance)
   are shown in the listing below:

   Definition:

   CommonFields = {
       ? time_format: TimeFormat
       ? reference_time: float64

       ? protocol_type: ProtocolType
       ? group_id: GroupID

       * text => any
   }

                     Figure 27: CommonFields definition

   Tools MUST be able to deal with these fields being defined either on
   each event individually or combined in common_fields.  Note that if
   at least one event in a trace has a different value for a given
   field, this field MUST NOT be added to common_fields but instead
   defined on each event individually.  Good example of such fields are
   "time" and "data", who are divergent by nature.

4.  Guidelines for event definition documents

   This document only defines the main schema for the qlog format.  This
   is intended to be used together with specific, per-protocol event
   definitions that specify the name (category + type) and data needed
   for each individual event.  This is with the intent to allow the qlog
   main schema to be easily re-used for several protocols.  Examples
   include the QUIC event definitions [QLOG-QUIC] and HTTP/3 and QPACK
   event definitions [QLOG-H3].

   This section defines some basic annotations and concepts the creators
   of event definition documents SHOULD follow to ensure a measure of
   consistency, making it easier for qlog implementers to extrapolate
   from one protocol to another.

4.1.  Event design guidelines

   TODO: pending QUIC working group discussion.  This text reflects the
   initial (qlog draft 01 and 02) setup.

   There are several ways of defining qlog events.  In practice, we have
   seen two main types used so far: a) those that map directly to
   concepts seen in the protocols (e.g., packet_sent) and b) those that
   act as aggregating events that combine data from several possible
   protocol behaviors or code paths into one (e.g., parameters_set).
   The latter are typically used as a means to reduce the amount of
   unique event definitions, as reflecting each possible protocol event
   as a separate qlog entity would cause an explosion of event types.

   Additionally, logging duplicate data is typically prevented as much
   as possible.  For example, packet header values that remain
   consistent across many packets are split into separate events (for
   example spin_bit_updated or connection_id_updated for QUIC).

   Finally, we have typically refrained from adding additional state
   change events if those state changes can be directly inferred from
   data on the wire (for example flow control limit changes) if the
   implementation is bug-free and spec-compliant.  Exceptions have been
   made for common events that benefit from being easily identifiable or
   individually logged (for example packets_acked).

4.2.  Event importance indicators

   Depending on how events are designed, it may be that several events
   allow the logging of similar or overlapping data.  For example the
   separate QUIC connection_started event overlaps with the more generic
   connection_state_updated.  In these cases, it is not always clear
   which event should be logged or used, and which event should take
   precedence if e.g., both are present and provide conflicting
   information.

   To aid in this decision making, we recommend that each event SHOULD
   have an "importance indicator" with one of three values, in
   decreasing order of importance and expected usage:

   *  Core

   *  Base

   *  Extra

   The "Core" events are the events that SHOULD be present in all qlog
   files for a given protocol.  These are typically tied to basic packet
   and frame parsing and creation, as well as listing basic internal
   metrics.  Tool implementers SHOULD expect and add support for these
   events, though SHOULD NOT expect all Core events to be present in
   each qlog trace.

   The "Base" events add additional debugging options and CAN be present
   in qlog files.  Most of these can be implicitly inferred from data in
   Core events (if those contain all their properties), but for many it
   is better to log the events explicitly as well, making it clearer how
   the implementation behaves.  These events are for example tied to
   passing data around in buffers, to how internal state machines change
   and help show when decisions are actually made based on received
   data.  Tool implementers SHOULD at least add support for showing the
   contents of these events, if they do not handle them explicitly.

   The "Extra" events are considered mostly useful for low-level
   debugging of the implementation, rather than the protocol.  They
   allow more fine-grained tracking of internal behavior.  As such, they
   CAN be present in qlog files and tool implementers CAN add support
   for these, but they are not required to.

   Note that in some cases, implementers might not want to log for
   example data content details in the "Core" events due to performance
   or privacy considerations.  In this case, they SHOULD use (a subset
   of) relevant "Base" events instead to ensure usability of the qlog
   output.  As an example, implementations that do not log QUIC
   packet_received events and thus also not which (if any) ACK frames
   the packet contains, SHOULD log packets_acked events instead.

   Finally, for event types whose data (partially) overlap with other
   event types' definitions, where necessary the event definition
   document should include explicit guidance on which to use in specific
   situations.

4.3.  Custom fields

   Event definition documents are free to define new category and event
   types, top-level fields (e.g., a per-event field indicating its
   privacy properties or path_id in multipath protocols), as well as
   values for the "trigger" property within the "data" field, or other
   member fields of the "data" field, as they see fit.

   They however SHOULD NOT expect non-specialized tools to recognize or
   visualize this custom data.  However, tools SHOULD make an effort to
   visualize even unknown data if possible in the specific tool's
   context.  If they do not, they MUST ignore these unknown fields.

5.  Generic events and data classes

   There are some event types and data classes that are common across
   protocols, applications and use cases that benefit from being defined
   in a single location.  This section specifies such common
   definitions.

5.1.  Raw packet and frame information

   While qlog is a more high-level logging format, it also allows the
   inclusion of most raw wire image information, such as byte lengths
   and even raw byte values.  This can be useful when for example
   investigating or tuning packetization behavior or determining
   encoding/framing overheads.  However, these fields are not always
   necessary and can take up considerable space if logged for each
   packet or frame.  They can also have a considerable privacy and
   security impact.  As such, they are grouped in a separate optional
   field called "raw" of type RawInfo (where applicable).

   Definition:

   RawInfo = {
       ; the full byte length of the entity (e.g., packet or frame),
       ; including headers and trailers
       ? length: uint64

       ; the byte length of the entity's payload,
       ; without headers or trailers
       ? payload_length: uint64

       ; the contents of the full entity,
       ; including headers and trailers
       ? data: hexstring
   }

                       Figure 28: RawInfo definition

   Note:  The RawInfo:data field can be truncated for privacy or
      security purposes (for example excluding payload data), see
      Section 6.1.2.  In this case, the length properties should still
      indicate the non-truncated lengths.

   Note:  We do not specify explicit header_length or trailer_length
      fields.  In most protocols, header_length can be calculated by
      subtracting the payload_length from the length (e.g., if
      trailer_length is always 0).  In protocols with trailers (e.g.,
      QUIC's AEAD tag), event definitions documents SHOULD define other
      ways of logging the trailer_length to make the header_length
      calculation possible.

      The exact definitions entities, headers, trailers and payloads
      depend on the protocol used.  If this is non-trivial, event
      definitions documents SHOULD include a clear explanation of how
      entities are mapped into the RawInfo structure.

   Note:  Relatedly, many modern protocols use Variable-Length Integer
      Encoded (VLIE) values in their headers, which are of a dynamic
      length.  Because of this, we cannot deterministically reconstruct
      the header encoding/length from non-RawInfo qlog data, as
      implementations might not necessarily employ the most efficient
      VLIE scheme for all values.  As such, to make exact size-analysis
      possible, implementers should use explicit lengths in RawInfo
      rather than reconstructing them from other qlog data.  Similarly,
      tool developers should only utilize RawInfo (and related
      information) in such tools to prevent errors.

5.2.  Generic events

   In typical logging setups, users utilize a discrete number of well-
   defined logging categories, levels or severities to log freeform
   (string) data.  This generic events category replicates this approach
   to allow implementations to fully replace their existing text-based
   logging by qlog.  This is done by providing events to log generic
   strings for the typical well-known logging levels (error, warning,
   info, debug, verbose).

   For the events defined below, the "category" is "generic" and their
   "type" is the name of the heading in lowercase (e.g., the "name" of
   the error event is "generic:error").

5.2.1.  error

   Importance: Core

   Used to log details of an internal error that might not get reflected
   on the wire.

   Definition:

   GenericError = {
       ? code: uint64
       ? message: text
   }

                     Figure 29: GenericError definition

5.2.2.  warning

   Importance: Base

   Used to log details of an internal warning that might not get
   reflected on the wire.

   Definition:

   GenericWarning = {
       ? code: uint64
       ? message: text
   }

                    Figure 30: GenericWarning definition

5.2.3.  info

   Importance: Extra

   Used mainly for implementations that want to use qlog as their one
   and only logging format but still want to support unstructured string
   messages.

   Definition:

   GenericInfo = {
       message: text
   }

                     Figure 31: GenericInfo definition

5.2.4.  debug

   Importance: Extra

   Used mainly for implementations that want to use qlog as their one
   and only logging format but still want to support unstructured string
   messages.

   Definition:

   GenericDebug = {
       message: text
   }

                     Figure 32: GenericDebug definition

5.2.5.  verbose

   Importance: Extra

   Used mainly for implementations that want to use qlog as their one
   and only logging format but still want to support unstructured string
   messages.

   Definition:

   GenericVerbose = {
       message: text
   }

                    Figure 33: GenericVerbose definition

5.3.  Simulation events

   When evaluating a protocol implementation, one typically sets up a
   series of interoperability or benchmarking tests, in which the test
   situations can change over time.  For example, the network bandwidth
   or latency can vary during the test, or the network can be fully
   disable for a short time.  In these setups, it is useful to know when
   exactly these conditions are triggered, to allow for proper
   correlation with other events.

   For the events defined below, the "category" is "simulation" and
   their "type" is the name of the heading in lowercase (e.g., the
   "name" of the scenario event is "simulation:scenario").

5.3.1.  scenario

   Importance: Extra

   Used to specify which specific scenario is being tested at this
   particular instance.  This could also be reflected in the top-level
   qlog's summary or configuration fields, but having a separate event
   allows easier aggregation of several simulations into one trace
   (e.g., split by group_id).

   Definition:

   SimulationScenario = {
       ? name: text
       ? details: {* text => any }
   }

                  Figure 34: SimulationScenario definition

5.3.2.  marker

   Importance: Extra

   Used to indicate when specific emulation conditions are triggered at
   set times (e.g., at 3 seconds in 2% packet loss is introduced, at 10s
   a NAT rebind is triggered).

   Definition:

   SimulationMarker = {
       ? type: text
       ? message: text
   }

                   Figure 35: SimulationMarker definition

6.  Serializing qlog

   This document and other related qlog schema definitions are
   intentionally serialization-format agnostic.  This means that
   implementers themselves can choose how to represent and serialize
   qlog data practically on disk or on the wire.  Some examples of
   possible formats are JSON, CBOR, CSV, protocol buffers, flatbuffers,
   etc.

   All these formats make certain tradeoffs between flexibility and
   efficiency, with textual formats like JSON typically being more
   flexible but also less efficient than binary formats like protocol
   buffers.  The format choice will depend on the practical use case of
   the qlog user.  For example, for use in day to day debugging, a
   plaintext readable (yet relatively large) format like JSON is
   probably preferred.  However, for use in production, a more optimized
   yet restricted format can be better.  In this latter case, it will be
   more difficult to achieve interoperability between qlog
   implementations of various protocol stacks, as some custom or tweaked
   events from one might not be compatible with the format of the other.
   This will also reflect in tooling: not all tools will support all
   formats.

   This being said, the authors prefer JSON as the basis for storing
   qlog, as it retains full flexibility and maximum interoperability.
   Storage overhead can be managed well in practice by employing
   compression.  For this reason, this document details how to
   practically transform qlog schema definitions to [JSON], its subset
   [I-JSON], and its streamable derivative [JSON-Text-Sequences]s.  We
   discuss concrete options to bring down JSON size and processing
   overheads in Section 6.3.

   As depending on the employed format different deserializers/parsers
   should be used, the "qlog_format" field is used to indicate the
   chosen serialization approach.  This field is always a string, but
   can be made hierarchical by the use of the "." separator between
   entries.  For example, a value of "JSON.optimizationA" can indicate
   that a default JSON format is being used, but that a certain
   optimization of type A was applied to the file as well (see also
   Section 6.3).

6.1.  qlog to JSON mapping

   When mapping qlog to normal JSON, the "qlog_format" field MUST have
   the value "JSON".  This is also the default qlog serialization and
   default value of this field.

   When using normal JSON serialization, the file extension/suffix
   SHOULD be ".qlog" and the Media Type (if any) SHOULD be "application/
   qlog+json" per [RFC6839].

   JSON files by definition ([RFC8259]) MUST utilize the UTF-8 encoding,
   both for the file itself and the string values.

   While not specifically required by the JSON specification, all qlog
   field names in a JSON serialization MUST be lowercase.

   In order to serialize CDDL-based qlog event and data structure
   definitions to JSON, the official CDDL-to-JSON mapping defined in
   Appendix E of [CDDL] SHOULD be employed.

6.1.1.  I-JSON

   For some use cases, it should be taken into account that not all
   popular JSON parsers support the full JSON format.  Especially for
   parsers integrated with the JavaScript programming language (e.g.,
   Web browsers, NodeJS), users are recommended to stick to a JSON
   subset dubbed [I-JSON] (or Internet-JSON).

   One of the key limitations of JavaScript and thus I-JSON is that it
   cannot represent full 64-bit integers in standard operating mode
   (i.e., without using BigInt extensions), instead being limited to the
   range of [-(2**53)+1, (2**53)-1].  In these circumstances, Appendix E
   of [CDDL] recommends defining new CDDL types for int64 and uint64
   that limit their values to this range.

   While this can be sensible and workable for most use cases, some
   protocols targeting qlog serialization (e.g., QUIC, HTTP/3), might
   require full uint64 variables in some (rare) circumstances.  In these
   situations, it should be allowed to also use the string-based
   representation of uint64 values alongside the numerical
   representation.  Concretely, the following definition of uint64
   should override the original and (web-based) tools should take into
   account that a uint64 field can be either a number or string.

   uint64 = text / uint .size 8

               Figure 36: Custom uint64 definition for I-JSON

6.1.2.  Truncated values

   For some use cases (e.g., limiting file size, privacy), it can be
   necessary not to log a full raw blob (using the hexstring type) but
   instead a truncated value (for example, only the first 100 bytes of
   an HTTP response body to be able to discern which file it actually
   contained).  In these cases, the original byte-size length cannot be
   obtained from the serialized value directly.

   As such, all qlog schema definitions SHOULD include a separate,
   length-indicating field for all fields of type hexstring they
   specify, see for example Section 5.1.  This not only ensures the
   original length can always be retrieved, but also allows the omission
   of any raw value bytes of the field completely (e.g., out of privacy
   or security considerations).

   To reduce overhead however and in the case the full raw value is
   logged, the extra length-indicating field can be left out.  As such,
   tools MUST be able to deal with this situation and derive the length
   of the field from the raw value if no separate length-indicating
   field is present.  The main possible permutations are shown by
   example in Figure 37.

   // both the full raw value and its length are present
   // (length is redundant)
   {
       "raw_length": 5,
       "raw": "051428abff"
   }

   // only the raw value is present, indicating it
   // represents the fields full value the byte
   // length is obtained by calculating raw.length / 2
   {
       "raw": "051428abff"
   }

   // only the length field is present, meaning the
   // value was omitted
   {
       "raw_length": 5,
   }

   // both fields are present and the lengths do not match:
   // the value was truncated to the first three bytes.
   {
       "raw_length": 5,
       "raw": "051428"
   }

          Figure 37: Example for serializing truncated hexstrings

6.2.  qlog to JSON Text Sequences mapping

   One of the downsides of using pure JSON is that it is inherently a
   non-streamable format.  Put differently, it is not possible to simply
   append new qlog events to a log file without "closing" this file at
   the end by appending "]}]}".  Without these closing tags, most JSON
   parsers will be unable to parse the file entirely.  As most platforms
   do not provide a standard streaming JSON parser (which would be able
   to deal with this problem), this document also provides a qlog
   mapping to a streamable JSON format called JSON Text Sequences (JSON-
   SEQ) ([RFC7464]).

   When mapping qlog to JSON-SEQ, the "qlog_format" field MUST have the
   value "JSON-SEQ".

   When using JSON-SEQ serialization, the file extension/suffix SHOULD
   be ".sqlog" (for "streaming" qlog) and the Media Type (if any) SHOULD
   be "application/qlog+json-seq" per [RFC8091].

   JSON Text Sequences are very similar to JSON, except that JSON
   objects are serialized as individual records, each prefixed by an
   ASCII Record Separator (<RS>, 0x1E), and each ending with an ASCII
   Line Feed character (\n, 0x0A).  Note that each record can also
   contain any amount of newlines in its body, as long as it ends with a
   newline character before the next <RS> character.

   Each qlog event is serialized and interpreted as an individual JSON
   Text Sequence record, and can simply be appended as a new object at
   the back of an event stream or log file.  Put differently, unlike
   default JSON, it does not require a file to be wrapped as a full
   object with "{ ... }" or "[... ]".

   For this to work, some qlog definitions have to be adjusted however.
   Mainly, events are no longer part of the "events" array in the Trace
   object, but are instead logged separately from the qlog "header", as
   indicated by the TraceSeq object in Figure 38.  Additionally, qlog's
   JSON-SEQ mapping does not allow logging multiple individual traces in
   a single qlog file.  As such, the QlogFile:traces field is replaced
   by the singular QlogFileSeq:trace field, see Figure 39.  An example
   can be seen in Figure 40.  Note that the "group_id" field can still
   be used on a per-event basis to include events from conceptually
   different sources in a single JSON-SEQ qlog file.

       ? title: text

   ...

                        Figure 40: Top-level element

   Note: while not specifically required by the JSON-SEQ specification,
   all qlog field names in a JSON-SEQ serialization MUST be lowercase.

   In order to serialize all other CDDL-based qlog event and data
   structure definitions to JSON-SEQ, the official CDDL-to-JSON mapping
   defined in Appendix E of [CDDL] SHOULD still be employed.

6.2.1.  Supporting JSON Text Sequences in tooling

   Note that JSON Text Sequences are not supported in most default
   programming environments (unlike normal JSON).  However, several
   custom JSON-SEQ parsing libraries exist in most programming languages
   that can be used and the format is easy enough to parse with existing
   implementations (i.e., by splitting the file into its component
   records and feeding them to a normal JSON parser individually, as
   each record by itself is a valid JSON object).

6.3.  Other optimized formatting options

   Both the JSON and JSON-SEQ formatting options described above are
   serviceable in general small to medium scale (debugging) setups.
   However, these approaches tend to be relatively verbose, leading to
   larger file sizes.  Additionally, generalized JSON(-SEQ)
   (de)serialization performance is typically (slightly) lower than that
   of more optimized and predictable formats.  Both aspects make these
   formats more challenging (though still practical
   (https://qlog.edm.uhasselt.be/anrw/)) to use in large scale setups.

   During the development of qlog, we compared a multitude of
   alternative formatting and optimization options.  The results of this
   study are summarized on the qlog github repository
   (https://github.com/quiclog/internet-drafts/issues/30#issuecomment-
   617675097).  The rest of this section discusses some of these
   approaches implementations could choose and the expected gains and
   tradeoffs inherent therein.  Tools SHOULD support mainly the
   compression options listed in Section 6.3.2, as they provide the
   largest wins for the least cost overall.

   Over time, specific qlog formats and encodings can be created that
   more formally define and combine some of the discussed optimizations
   or add new ones.  We choose to define these schemes in separate
   documents to keep the main qlog definition clean and generalizable,
   as not all contexts require the same performance or flexibility as
   others and qlog is intended to be a broadly usable and extensible
   format (for example more flexibility is needed in earlier stages of
   protocol development, while more performance is typically needed in
   later stages).  This is also the main reason why the general qlog
   format is the less optimized JSON instead of a more performant
   option.

   To be able to easily distinguish between these options in qlog
   compatible tooling (without the need to have the user provide out-of-
   band information or to (heuristically) parse and process files in a
   multitude of ways, see also Section 8), we recommend using explicit
   file extensions to indicate specific formats.  As there are no
   standards in place for this type of extension to format mapping, we
   employ a commonly used scheme here.  Our approach is to list the
   applied optimizations in the extension in ascending order of
   application (e.g., if a qlog file is first optimized with technique A
   and then compressed with technique B, the resulting file would have
   the extension ".(s)qlog.A.B").  This allows tooling to start at the
   back of the extension to "undo" applied optimizations to finally
   arrive at the expected qlog representation.

6.3.1.  Data structure optimizations

   The first general category of optimizations is to alter the
   representation of data within an JSON(-SEQ) qlog file to reduce file
   size.

   The first option is to employ a scheme similar to the CSV (comma
   separated value [RFC4180]) format, which utilizes the concept of
   column "headers" to prevent repeating field names for each datapoint
   instance.  Concretely for JSON qlog, several field names are repeated
   with each event (i.e., time, name, data).  These names could be
   extracted into a separate list, after which qlog events could be
   serialized as an array of values, as opposed to a full object.  This
   approach was a key part of the original qlog format (prior to draft-
   02) using the "event_fields" field.  However, tests showed that this
   optimization only provided a mean file size reduction of 5% (100MB to
   95MB) while significantly increasing the implementation complexity,
   and this approach was abandoned in favor of the default JSON setup.
   Implementations using this format should not employ a separate file
   extension (as it still uses JSON), but rather employ a new value of
   "JSON.namedheaders" (or "JSON-SEQ.namedheaders") for the
   "qlog_format" field (see Section 3).

   The second option is to replace field values and/or names with
   indices into a (dynamic) lookup table.  This is a common compression
   technique and can provide significant file size reductions (up to 50%
   in our tests, 100MB to 50MB).  However, this approach is even more
   difficult to implement efficiently and requires either including the
   (dynamic) table in the resulting file (an approach taken by for
   example Chromium's NetLog format
   (https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/network-stack/
   netlog)) or defining a (static) table up-front and sharing this
   between implementations.  Implementations using this approach should
   not employ a separate file extension (as it still uses JSON), but
   rather employ a new value of "JSON.dictionary" (or "JSON-
   SEQ.dictionary") for the "qlog_format" field (see Section 3).

   As both options either proved difficult to implement, reduced qlog
   file readability, and provided too little improvement compared to
   other more straightforward options (for example Section 6.3.2), these
   schemes are not inherently part of qlog.

6.3.2.  Compression

   The second general category of optimizations is to utilize a
   (generic) compression scheme for textual data.  As qlog in the JSON(-
   SEQ) format typically contains a large amount of repetition, off-the-
   shelf (text) compression techniques typically succeed very well in
   bringing down file sizes (regularly with up to two orders of
   magnitude in our tests, even for "fast" compression levels).  As
   such, utilizing compression is recommended before attempting other
   optimization options, even though this might (somewhat) increase
   processing costs due to the additional compression step.

   The first option is to use GZIP compression ([RFC1952]).  This
   generic compression scheme provides multiple compression levels
   (providing a trade-off between compression speed and size reduction).
   Utilized at level 6 (a medium setting thought to be applicable for
   streaming compression of a qlog stream in commodity devices), gzip
   compresses qlog JSON files to 7% of their initial size on average
   (100MB to 7MB).  For this option, the file extension .(s)qlog.gz
   SHOULD BE used.  The "qlog_format" field should still reflect the
   original JSON formatting of the qlog data (e.g., "JSON" or "JSON-
   SEQ").

   The second option is to use Brotli compression ([RFC7932]).  While
   similar to gzip, this more recent compression scheme provides a
   better efficiency.  It also allows multiple compression levels.
   Utilized at level 4 (a medium setting thought to be applicable for
   streaming compression of a qlog stream in commodity devices), brotli
   compresses qlog JSON files to 7% of their initial size on average
   (100MB to 7MB).  For this option, the file extension .(s)qlog.br
   SHOULD BE used.  The "qlog_format" field should still reflect the
   original JSON formatting of the qlog data (e.g., "JSON" or "JSON-
   SEQ").

   Other compression algorithms of course exist (for example xz, zstd,
   and lz4).  We mainly recommend gzip and brotli because of their
   tweakable behaviour and wide support in web-based environments, which
   we envision as the main tooling ecosystem (see also Section 8).

6.3.3.  Binary formats

   The third general category of optimizations is to use a more
   optimized (often binary) format instead of the textual JSON format.
   This approach inherently produces smaller files and often has better
   (de)serialization performance.  However, the resultant files are no
   longer human readable and some formats require hard tradeoffs between
   flexibility for performance.

   The first option is to use the CBOR (Concise Binary Object
   Representation [RFC7049]) format.  For our purposes, CBOR can be
   viewed as a straightforward binary variant of JSON.  As such,
   existing JSON qlog files can be trivially converted to and from CBOR
   (though slightly more work is needed for JSON-SEQ qlogs to convert
   them to CBOR-SEQ, see [RFC8742]).  While CBOR thus does retain the
   full qlog flexibility, it only provides a 25% file size reduction
   (100MB to 75MB) compared to textual JSON(-SEQ).  As CBOR support in
   programming environments is not as widespread as that of textual JSON
   and the format lacks human readability, CBOR was not chosen as the
   default qlog format.  For this option, the file extension
   .(s)qlog.cbor SHOULD BE used.  The "qlog_format" field should still
   reflect the original JSON formatting of the qlog data (e.g., "JSON"
   or "JSON-SEQ").  The media type should indicate both whether JSON or
   JSON Text Sequences are used, as well as whether CBOR or CBOR
   Sequences are used (see the table below).

   A second option is to use a more specialized binary format, such as
   Protocol Buffers (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)
   (protobuf).  This format is battle-tested, has support for optional
   fields and has libraries in most programming languages.  Still, it is
   significantly less flexible than textual JSON or CBOR, as it relies
   on a separate, pre-defined schema (a .proto file).  As such, it it
   not possible to (easily) log new event types in protobuf files
   without adjusting this schema as well, which has its own practical
   challenges.  As qlog is intended to be a flexible, general purpose
   format, this type of format was not chosen as its basic
   serialization.  The lower flexibility does lead to significantly
   reduced file sizes.  Our straightforward mapping of the qlog main
   schema and QUIC/HTTP3 event types to protobuf created qlog files 24%
   as large as the raw JSON equivalents (100MB to 24MB).  For this
   option, the file extension .(s)qlog.protobuf SHOULD BE used.  The
   "qlog_format" field should reflect the different internal format, for
   example: "qlog_format": "protobuf".

   Note that binary formats can (and should) also be used in conjunction
   with compression (see Section 6.3.2).  For example, CBOR compresses
   well (to about 6% of the original textual JSON size (100MB to 6MB)
   for both gzip and brotli) and so does protobuf (5% (gzip) to 3%
   (brotli)).  However, these gains are similar to the ones achieved by
   simply compression the textual JSON equivalents directly (7%, see
   Section 6.3.2).  As such, since compression is still needed to
   achieve optimal file size reductions event with binary formats, we
   feel the more flexible compressed textual JSON options are a better
   default for the qlog format in general.


6.3.4.  Overview and summary

   In summary, textual JSON was chosen as the main qlog format due to
   its high flexibility and because its inefficiencies can be largely
   solved by the utilization of compression techniques (which are needed
   to achieve optimal results with other formats as well).

   Still, qlog implementers are free to define other qlog formats
   depending on their needs and context of use.  These formats should be
   described in their own documents, the discussion in this document
   mainly acting as inspiration and high-level guidance.  Implementers
   are encouraged to add concrete qlog formats and definitions to the
   designated public repository (https://github.com/quiclog/qlog).

   The following table provides an overview of all the discussed qlog
   formatting options with examples:

6.4.  Conversion between formats

   As discussed in the previous sections, a qlog file can be serialized
   in a multitude of formats, each of which can conceivably be
   transformed into or from one another without loss of information.
   For example, a number of JSON-SEQ streamed qlogs could be combined
   into a JSON formatted qlog for later processing.  Similarly, a
   captured binary qlog could be transformed to JSON for easier
   interpretation and sharing.

   Secondly, we can also consider other structured logging approaches
   that contain similar (though typically not identical) data to qlog,
   like raw packet capture files (for example .pcap files from tcpdump)
   or endpoint-specific logging formats (for example the NetLog format
   in Google Chrome).  These are sometimes the only options, if an
   implementation cannot or will not support direct qlog output for any
   reason, but does provide other internal or external (e.g.,
   SSLKEYLOGFILE export to allow decryption of packet captures) logging
   options For this second category, a (partial) transformation from/to
   qlog can also be defined.

   As such, when defining a new qlog serialization format or wanting to
   utilize qlog-compatible tools with existing codebases lacking qlog
   support, it is recommended to define and provide a concrete mapping
   from one format to default JSON-serialized qlog.  Several of such
   mappings exist.  Firstly, [pcap2qlog]((https://github.com/quiclog/
   pcap2qlog) transforms QUIC and HTTP/3 packet capture files to qlog.
   Secondly, netlog2qlog
   (https://github.com/quiclog/qvis/tree/master/visualizations/src/
   components/filemanager/netlogconverter) converts chromium's internal
   dictionary-encoded JSON format to qlog.  Finally, quictrace2qlog
   (https://github.com/quiclog/quictrace2qlog) converts the older
   quictrace format to JSON qlog.  Tools can then easily integrate with
   these converters (either by incorporating them directly or for
   example using them as a (web-based) API) so users can provide
   different file types with ease.  For example, the qvis
   (https://qvis.edm.uhasselt.be) toolsuite supports a multitude of
   formats and qlog serializations.

7.  Methods of access and generation

   Different implementations will have different ways of generating and
   storing qlogs.  However, there is still value in defining a few
   default ways in which to steer this generation and access of the
   results.

7.1.  Set file output destination via an environment variable

   To provide users control over where and how qlog files are created,
   we define two environment variables.  The first, QLOGFILE, indicates
   a full path to where an individual qlog file should be stored.  This
   path MUST include the full file extension.  The second, QLOGDIR, sets
   a general directory path in which qlog files should be placed.  This
   path MUST include the directory separator character at the end.

   In general, QLOGDIR should be preferred over QLOGFILE if an endpoint
   is prone to generate multiple qlog files.  This can for example be
   the case for a QUIC server implementation that logs each QUIC
   connection in a separate qlog file.  An alternative that uses
   QLOGFILE would be a QUIC server that logs all connections in a single
   file and uses the "group_id" field (Section 3.4.6) to allow post-hoc
   separation of events.

   Implementations SHOULD provide support for QLOGDIR and MAY provide
   support for QLOGFILE.

   When using QLOGDIR, it is up to the implementation to choose an
   appropriate naming scheme for the qlog files themselves.  The chosen
   scheme will typically depend on the context or protocols used.  For
   example, for QUIC, it is recommended to use the Original Destination
   Connection ID (ODCID), followed by the vantage point type of the
   logging endpoint.  Examples of all options for QUIC are shown in
   Figure 41.

   Command: QLOGFILE=/srv/qlogs/client.qlog quicclientbinary

   Should result in the the quicclientbinary executable logging a
   single qlog file named client.qlog in the /srv/qlogs directory.
   This is for example useful in tests when the client sets up
   just a single connection and then exits.

   Command: QLOGDIR=/srv/qlogs/ quicserverbinary

   Should result in the quicserverbinary executable generating
   several logs files, one for each QUIC connection.
   Given two QUIC connections, with ODCID values "abcde" and
   "12345" respectively, this would result in two files:
   /srv/qlogs/abcde_server.qlog
   /srv/qlogs/12345_server.qlog

   Command: QLOGFILE=/srv/qlogs/server.qlog quicserverbinary

   Should result in the the quicserverbinary executable logging
   a single qlog file named server.qlog in the /srv/qlogs directory.
   Given that the server handled two QUIC connections before it was
   shut down, with ODCID values "abcde" and "12345" respectively,
   this would result in event instances in the qlog file being
   tagged with the "group_id" field with values "abcde" and "12345".

     Figure 41: Environment variable examples for a QUIC implementation

7.2.  Access logs via a well-known endpoint

   After generation, qlog implementers MAY make available generated logs
   and traces on an endpoint (typically the server) via the following
   .well-known URI:

      .well-known/qlog/IDENTIFIER.extension

   The IDENTIFIER variable depends on the context and the protocol.  For
   example for QUIC, the lowercase Original Destination Connection ID
   (ODCID) is recommended, as it can uniquely identify a connection.
   Additionally, the extension depends on the chosen format (see
   Section 6.3.4).  For example, for a QUIC connection with ODCID
   "abcde", the endpoint for fetching its default JSON-formatted .qlog
   file would be:

      .well-known/qlog/abcde.qlog

   Implementers SHOULD allow users to fetch logs for a given connection
   on a 2nd, separate connection.  This helps prevent pollution of the
   logs by fetching them over the same connection that one wishes to
   observe through the log.  Ideally, for the QUIC use case, the logs
   should also be approachable via an HTTP/2 or HTTP/1.1 endpoint (i.e.,
   on TCP port 443), to for example aid debugging in the case where
   QUIC/UDP is blocked on the network.

   qlog implementers SHOULD NOT enable this .well-known endpoint in
   typical production settings to prevent (malicious) users from
   downloading logs from other connections.  Implementers are advised to
   disable this endpoint by default and require specific actions from
   the end users to enable it (and potentially qlog itself).
   Implementers MUST also take into account the general privacy and
   security guidelines discussed in Section 9 before exposing qlogs to
   outside actors.

8.  Tooling requirements

   Tools ingestion qlog MUST indicate which qlog version(s), qlog
   format(s), compression methods and potentially other input file
   formats (for example .pcap) they support.  Tools SHOULD at least
   support .qlog files in the default JSON format (Section 6.1).
   Additionally, they SHOULD indicate exactly which values for and
   properties of the name (category and type) and data fields they look
   for to execute their logic.  Tools SHOULD perform a (high-level)
   check if an input qlog file adheres to the expected qlog schema.  If
   a tool determines a qlog file does not contain enough supported
   information to correctly execute the tool's logic, it SHOULD generate
   a clear error message to this effect.

   Tools MUST NOT produce breaking errors for any field names and/or
   values in the qlog format that they do not recognize.  Tools SHOULD
   indicate even unknown event occurrences within their context (e.g.,
   marking unknown events on a timeline for manual interpretation by the
   user).

   Tool authors should be aware that, depending on the logging
   implementation, some events will not always be present in all traces.
   For example, using a circular logging buffer of a fixed size, it
   could be that the earliest events (e.g., connection setup events) are
   later overwritten by "newer" events.  Alternatively, some events can
   be intentionally omitted out of privacy or file size considerations.
   Tool authors are encouraged to make their tools robust enough to
   still provide adequate output for incomplete logs.

9.  Security and privacy considerations

   Protocols such as TLS [RFC8446] and QUIC [RFC9000] provide varying
   degrees of secure protection for the wire image [RFC8546].  There is
   inevitably tension between security and observability, when logging
   can reveal aspects of the wire image, that would ordinarily be
   protected.  This tension equally applies to any privacy
   considerations that build on security properties, especially if data
   can be correlated across data sources.

   qlog operators and implementers should be mindful of the security and
   privacy risks inherent in handling qlog data.  This includes but is
   not limited to logging, storing, or using the data.  Data might be
   considered as non-sensitive, potentially-sensitive, or sensitive;
   applying the considerations in this section may produce different
   risks depending on the nature of the data itself, or its handling.
   However, in many cases the largest risk factors arise from data that
   can be considered as potenially-sensitive or sensitive.

   The following is a non-exhaustive list of such fields and types of
   data that can be carried in qlog data:

   *  IP addresses and transport protocol port numbers, which can be
      used to uniquely identify individual connections, endpoints, and
      potentially users.

   *  Session, Connection, or User identifiers which can be used to
      correlate nominally separate contexts.  For example, QUIC
      Connection IDs can be used to identify and track users across
      geographical networks Section 9.5 of [RFC9000]).

   *  Stored State which can be used to correlate individual connections
      or sessions over time.  Examples include QUIC address validation
      and retry tokens, TLS session tickets, and HTTP cookies.

   *  Decryption keys, passwords, and tokens which can be used with
      other data sources (e.g., captures of encrypted packets) to
      correlate qlog data to a specific connection or user or leak
      additional information.  Examples include TLS decryption keys and
      HTTP-level API access or authorization tokens.

   *  Data that can be used to correlate qlogs to other data sources
      (e.g., captures of encrypted packets).  Examples include high-
      resolution event timestamps or inter-event timings, event counts,
      packet and frame sizes.

   *  Full or partial encrypted raw packet and frame payloads, which can
      be used with other data sources (e.g., captures of encrypted
      packets) to correlate qlog data to a specific connection or
      session.

   *  Full or partial plaintext raw packet and frame payloads (e.g.,
      HTTP Field values, HTTP response data, TLS SNI field values),
      which can contain directly sensitive information.

   The simplest and most extreme form of protection against abuse of
   this information is the complete deletion of a given field, which is
   equivalent to not logging the field(s) in question.  While deletion
   completely protects the data in the deleted fields from the risk of
   compromise, it also reduces the utility of the dataset as a whole.
   As such, a balance should be found between logging these fields and
   the potential risks inherent in their (involuntary) disclosure.  This
   balance depends on the use case at hand (e.g., research datasets
   might have different requirements to live operational
   troubleshooting).  Capturing the minimal amount of data required for
   a specific purpose can help to minimize the risks associated with
   data usage. qlog implementations that provide fine-grained control
   over the inclusion of data fields, ideally on a per-use-case or per-
   connection basis, improve the ability to minimize data.

   Any data that is determined to be necessary for a use case at hand
   could be logged or captured.  As per [RFC6973], operators must be
   aware that such data will be at risk of compromise.  As such,
   measures should be taken to firstly reduce the risk of compromise and
   secondly reduce the risk of abuse of compromised data.  While a full
   discussion of both aspects is out of scope for this document, the
   following paragraphs discuss high-level considerations that can be
   applied to qlog data.

   To reduce the risk of compromise, operators can take measures such
   as: limiting the length of time that data is stored, encrypting data
   in transit and at rest, limiting access rights to the data, and
   auditing data usage practices. qlog deployments that provide
   integrated options for automated or manual data deletion and
   (aggressive) aggregation, improve the ability to minimize the risk of
   compromise.

   To reduce the risk of data abuse after compromise, data can be
   anonymized, pseudonymized, otherwise permutated/replaced, truncated,
   (re-)encrypted, or aggregated.  A partial discussion of applicable
   techniques (especially for IP address information) can be found in
   Appendix B of [DNS-PRIVACY].  Operators should, however, be aware
   that many of these techniques have been shown to be insufficient to
   safeguard user privacy and/or to protect user identity, especially if
   a qlog data set is large or easily correlated against other data
   sources.

   Finally, qlog operators should consider the interplay between their
   use case needs and end user rights or preferences.  While active user
   participation (as indicated by [RFC6973]) on a per-qlog basis is
   difficult, as logs are often captured out-of-band to the main user
   interaction and intent, general user expectations should be taken
   into account. qlog deployments that provide mechanisms to integrate
   the capture, storage and removal of qlogs with more general, often
   pre-existing, user preference and privacy control systems, improve
   the ability to protect data sensitive or confidential to the end
   user.  In qlog, these data are typically (but not exclusively)
   contained in fields of the RawInfo type (see Section 5.1). qlog users
   should thus be particularly hesitant to include these fields for all
   but the most stringent use cases.
