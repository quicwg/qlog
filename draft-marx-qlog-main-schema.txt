Abstract

   This document describes a high-level schema for a standardized
   logging format called qlog.  This format allows easy sharing of data
   and the creation of reusable visualization and debugging tools.  The
   high-level schema in this document is intended to be protocol-
   agnostic.  Separate documents specify how the format should be used
   for specific protocol data.

1.  Introduction

   There is currently a lack of an easily usable, standardized endpoint
   logging format.  Especially for the use case of debugging and
   evaluating modern web protocols and their performance, it is often
   difficult to obtain structured logs that provide adequate information
   for tasks like problem root cause analysis.

   This document aims to provide a high-level schema and harness that
   describes the general layout of an easily usable, shareable,
   aggregatable and structured logging format.  This high-level schema
   is protocol agnostic, with logging entries for specific protocols and

   use cases being defined in other documents (see for example
   [QLOG-QUIC-HTTP3] for QUIC and HTTP/3-related event definitions).

   The goal of this high-level schema is to provide amenities and
   default characteristics that each logging file should contain (or
   should be able to contain), such that generic and reusable toolsets
   can be created that can deal with logs from a variety of different
   protocols and use cases.

   As such, this document contains concepts such as versioning, metadata
   inclusion, log aggregation, event grouping and log file size
   reduction techniques.

   Feedback and discussion welcome at https://github.com/quiclog/

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Design Goals

   The main tenets for the qlog schema design are:

   *  Streamable, event-based logging

   *  Flexibility in the format, complexity in the tooling (e.g., few
      components are a MUST, tools need to deal with this)

   *  Extensible and pragmatic (e.g., no complex fixed schema with
      extension points)

   *  Aggregation and transformation friendly (e.g., the top-level
      element is a container for individual traces)

   *  Metadata is stored together with event data

   *  Explicit and human-readable

3.  The High Level Schema

   A qlog file should be able to contain several indivdual traces and
   logs from multiple vantage points that are in some way related.  To
   that end, the top-level element in the qlog schema defines only a
   small set of fields and an array of component traces.  Only the
   "qlog_version" and "traces" fields MUST be present.  For this
   document, the "qlog_version" field MUST have a value of "draft-
   02-wip".

   {
       "qlog_version": "draft-02-wip",
       "title": "Name of this particular qlog file (short)",
       "description": "Description for this group of traces (long)",
       "summary": {
           ...
       }
       "traces": [...]
   }

                        Figure 1: Top-level element

3.1.  Traces field

   Required: yes

   The "traces" array contains a list of individual qlog traces.
   Typical logs will only contain a single element in this array.
   Multiple traces can however be combined into a single qlog file by
   taking the "traces" entries for each qlog file individually and
   copying them to the "traces" array of a new, aggregated qlog file.
   This is typically done in a post-processing step.

   For example, for a test setup, we perform logging on the client, on
   the server and on a single point on their common network path.  Each
   of these three logs is first created separately during the test.
   Afterwards, the three logs can be aggregated into a single qlog file.

   As such, the "traces" array can also contain "error" entries.  These
   indicate that we tried to find/convert a file for inclusion in the
   aggregated qlog, but there was an error during the process.  Rather
   than silently dropping the erroneous file, we can opt to explicitly
   include it in the qlog file as an entry in the "traces" array.

   An error is defined as follows.  The uri and vantage_point fields are
   optional.  The "error_description" field MUST be present and can be
   used by tools to identify the presence of an error.

   {
       "error_description": "A description of the error (e.g., file could not be found, file had errors, ...)",
       "uri": "the original URI at which we attempted to find the file",
       "vantage_point": see {{vantage_point}} // the vantage point we were expecting to include here
   }

3.2.  Summary field

   Required: no

   In a real-life deployment with a large amount of generated logs, it
   can be useful to sort and filter logs based on some basic summarized
   or aggregated data (e.g., log length, packet loss rate, log location,
   presence of error events, ...).  The summary field (if present)
   SHOULD be on top of the qlog file, as this allows for the file to be
   processed in a streaming fashion (i.e., the implementation could just
   read up to and including the summary field and then only load the
   full logs that are deemed interesting by the user).

   As the summary field is highly deployment-specific, this document
   does not specify any default fields or their semantics.  Some
   examples of potential entries are:

   "summary": {
       "trace_count":number, // amount of traces in this file
       "max_duration":string, // time duration of the longest trace
       "max_outgoing_loss_rate":number, // highest loss rate for outgoing packets over all traces
       "total_event_count":number, // total number of events across all traces,
       "error_count":number // total number of error events in this trace
   }

3.2.1.  Title and Description

   Required: no

   Both fields' values are generic strings, used for describing the
   contents of the entire qlog file.  These can either be filled in
   automatically (e.g., including the timestamp when the file was
   generated, the specific test case or simulation these logs were
   collected from), or can be filled manually when creating aggregated
   logs (e.g., qlog files that illustrate a specific problem across
   traces that want to include additional explanations for easier
   communication between teams, students, ...).

3.3.  Individual trace containers

   Each indidivual trace container encompasses a single conceptual
   trace.  The exact definition of a trace can be fluid.  For example, a
   trace could contain all events for a single connection, for a single
   endpoint, for a single measurement interval, etc.

   In the normal use case, a trace is a log of a single data flow
   collected at a single location or vantage point.  For example, for
   QUIC, a single trace only contains events for a single logical QUIC
   connection for either the client or the server.  However, a single
   trace could also combine events from a variety of vantage points or
   use cases (e.g., a middlebox could group events from all observed
   connections into a single trace).

   The semantics and context of the trace can be deduced from the
   entries in the "common_fields" (specifically the "group_id" field)
   and "event_fields" lists.

   Only the "vantage_point", "event_fields" and "events" fields MUST be
   present.

   {
       "vantage_point": {
           "name": "backend-67",
           "type": "server"
       },
       "title": "Name of this particular trace (short)",
       "description": "Description for this trace (long)",
       "configuration": {
           "time_units": "ms" | "us",
           "time_offset": "offset to help align trace start times"
       },
       "common_fields": (see below),
       "event_fields": (see below),
       "events": [...]
   }

                         Figure 2: Trace container

3.3.1.  vantage_point

   Required: yes

   This field describes the vantage point from which the trace
   originates.  Each trace can have only a single vantage_point and thus
   all events in a trace MUST BE from the perspective of this
   vantage_point.  To include events from multiple vantage_points,

   implementers can include multiple traces, split by vantage_point, in
   a single qlog file.

   Its value is an object, with the following fields:

   *  name: a user-chosen string (e.g., "NETWORK-1", "loadbalancer45",
      "reverseproxy@192.168.1.1", ...)

   *  type: one of four values: "server", "client", "network" or
      "unknown".

      -  client indicates an endpoint which initiates the connection.

      -  server indicates an endpoint which accepts the connection.

      -  network indicates an observer in between client and server.

      -  unknown indicates the endpoint is unknown.

   *  flow: one of three values: "client", "server" or "unknown".

      -  This field is only required if type is "network".

      -  "client" indicates that this vantage point follows client data
         flow semantics (a "packet sent" event goes in the direction of
         the server).

      -  "server" indicates that this vantage point follow server data
         flow semantics (a "packet sent" event goes in the direction of
         the client).

      -  "unknown" indicates that the flow is unknown.

   The type field MUST be present.  The flow field MUST be present if
   the type field has value "network".  The name field is optional.

   The flow field is necessary because for multiple reasons (e.g.,
   privacy) data from which the flow direction might be inferred (e.g.,
   IP addresses) might not be present in the logs.

   Depending on the context, tools confronted with "unknown" values in
   the vantage_point can either try to infer the semantics from
   protocol-level domain knowledge (e.g., in QUIC, the client sends an
   Initial packet) or give the user the option to switch between client
   and server perspectives.

3.3.2.  Title and Description

   Required: no

   Both fields' values are generic strings, used for describing the
   contents of the trace.  These can either be filled in automatically
   (e.g., showing the endpoint name and readable timestamp of the log),
   or can be filled manually when creating aggregated logs (e.g., qlog
   files that illustrate a specific problem across traces that want to
   include additional explanations for easier communication between
   teams, students, ...).

3.3.3.  Configuration

   Required: no

   We take into account that a log file is usually not used in
   isolation, but by means of various tools.  Especially when
   aggregating various traces together or preparing traces for a
   demonstration, one might wish to persist certain tool-based settings
   inside the log file itself.  For this, the configuration field is
   used.

   The configuration field can be viewed as a generic metadata field
   that tools can fill with their own fields, based on per-tool logic.
   It is best practice for tools to prefix each added field with their
   tool name to prevent collisions across tools.  This document only
   defines three optional, standard, tool-independent configuration
   settings: "time_units", "time_offset" and "original_uris".

3.3.3.1.  time_units

   Since timestamps and other time-related values can be stored in
   various granularities, this field allows to indicate whether storage
   happens in either milliseconds ("ms") or microseconds ("us").  If
   this field is not present, the default value is "ms".  This
   configuration setting applies to all other timestamps and time-
   related values in the trace file and its consituent events as well,
   not just the "time_offset" field.

3.3.3.2.  time_offset

   time_offset indicates by how many units of time the starting time of
   the current trace should be offset.  This is useful when comparing
   logs taken from various systems, where clocks might not be perfectly
   synchronous.  Users could use manual tools or automated logic to
   align traces in time and the found optimal offsets can be stored in
   this field for future usage.  The default value is "0".

Internet-Draft        Main logging schema for qlog            March 2020


3.3.3.3.  original_uris

   This field is used when merging multiple individual qlog files or
   other source files (e.g., when converting .pcaps to qlog).  It allows
   to keep better track where certain data came from.  It is a simple
   array of strings.  It is an array instead of a single string, since a
   single qlog trace can be made up out of an aggregation of multiple
   component qlog traces as well.  The default value is an empty array.

3.3.3.4.  custom fields

   Tools can add optional custom metadata to the "configuration" field
   to store state and make it easier to share specific data viewpoints
   and view configurations.

   An example from the qvis toolset (https://qvis.edm.uhasselt.be)'s
   congestion graph follows.  In this example, the congestion graph is
   zoomed in between 1s and 2s of the trace and the 124th event in the
   trace is selected.

   {
       "configuration" : {
           "time_offset": "100",
           "time_units": "ms" | "us",
           "qvis" : {
               "congestiongraph": {
                   "startX": 1000,
                   "endX": 2000,
                   "selectedEvent": 124
               }
           }
       }
   }

3.3.4.  common_fields and event_fields

   Required: event_fields only

   To reduce file size and make logging easier, the trace schema lists
   the names of the specific fields that are logged per-event up-front,
   instead of repeating the field name with each value, as is common in
   traditiona JSON.  This is done in the "event_fields" list.  This
   allows us to encode individual events as an array of values, instead
   of an object.  To reduce file size even further, common event fields
   that have the same value for all events in this trace, are listed as
   name-value pairs in "common_fields".

   For example, when logging events for a single QUIC connection, all
   events will share the same "original destination connection ID"
   (ODCID).  This field and its value should be set in "common_fields",
   rather than "event_fields".  However, if a single trace would contain
   events for multiple QUIC connections at the same time (e.g., a
   single, big output log for a server), the ODCID can be different
   across events, and should be part of "event_fields" instead (leading
   to it being logged for each individual event).

   Examples comparing traditional JSON vs the qlog format can be found
   in Figure 3 and Figure 4.  The events described in these examples are
   purely for illustration.  Actual event type definitions for the QUIC
   and HTTP/3 protocols can be found in [QLOG-QUIC-HTTP3].

   The main field names that can be included in these fields are defined
   in Section 3.4.

   Given that qlog is intended to be a flexible format, unknown field
   names in both "common_fields" and "event_fields" MUST be disregarded
   by the user and tools (i.e., the presence of an uknown field is
   explicitly NOT an error).

   This approach makes line-per-line logging easier and faster, as each
   log statement only needs to include the data for the events, not the
   field names.  Events can also be logged and processed separately, as
   part of a contiguous event-stream.

3.3.4.1.  common_fields format

   An object containing pairs of "field name"-"field value".  Fields
   included in "common_fields" indicate that these field values are the
   same for each event in the "events" array.

Internet-Draft        Main logging schema for qlog            March 2020


   If even one event in the trace does not adhere to this convention,
   that field name should be in "event_fields" instead, and the value
   logged per event.  An alternative route is to include the most
   commonly seen value in "common_fields" and then include the deviating
   field value in the generic "data" field for each non-confirming
   event.  However, these semantics are not defined in this document.

3.3.4.2.  event_fields format

   An array of field names (plain strings).  Field names included in
   "event_fields" indicate that these field names are present *in this
   exact order* for each event in the "events" array.  Each individual
   event then only has to log the corresponding values for those fields
   in the correct order.

3.4.  Field name semantics

   This section lists pre-defined, reserved field names with specific
   semantics and expected corresponding value formats.

   Only one time-based field (see Section 3.4.1), the "event" field and
   the "data" field are mandatory.  Typical setups will log
   "reference_time", "protocol_type" and "group_id" in "common_fields"
   and "relative_time", "category", "event" and "data" in
   "event_fields".

   Other field names are allowed, both in "common_fields" and
   "event_fields", but their semantics depend on the context of the log
   usage (e.g., for QUIC, the ODCID field is used), see
   [QLOG-QUIC-HTTP3].

3.4.1.  time, delta_time and reference_time + relative_time

   Required: one of these

   There are three main modes for logging time:

   *  Include the full timestamp with each event ("time").  This
      approach uses the largest amount of characters.

   *  Delta-encode each time value on the previously logged value
      ("delta_time").  The first event can log the full timestamp.  This
      approach uses the least amount of characters.

   *  Specify a full "reference_time" timestamp up-front in
      "common_fields" and include only relatively-encoded values based
      on this reference_time with each event ("relative_time").  This
      approach uses a medium amount of characters.

Internet-Draft        Main logging schema for qlog            March 2020


   The first option is good for stateless loggers, the second and third
   for stateful loggers.  The third option is generally preferred, since
   it produces smaller files while being easier to reason about.

   The time approach will use:
   1500, 1505, 1522, 1588

   The delta_time approach will use:
   1500, 5, 17, 66

   The relative_time approach will:
   - set the reference_time to 1500 in "common_fields"
   - use: 0, 5, 22, 88

        Figure 5: Three different approaches for logging timestamps

   Events in each individual trace MUST be logged in strictly ascending
   timestamp order (though not necessarily absolute value, for the
   "delta_time" setup).  Tools are NOT expected to sort all events on
   the timestamp before processing them.

3.4.2.  group_id

   Required: no, but recommended

   A single Trace can contain events from a variety of sources,
   belonging to for example a number of individual QUIC connections.
   For tooling considerations, it is necessary to have a well-defined
   way to split up events belonging to different logical groups into
   subgroups for visualization and processing.  For example, if one type
   of log uses 4-tuples as identifiers and uses a field name
   "four_tuple" and another uses "ODCID", there is no way to know for
   generic tools which of these fields should be used to create
   subgroups.  As such, qlog uses the generic "group_id" field to
   circumvent this issue.

   The "group_id" field can be any type of valid JSON object, but is
   typically a string or integer.  For more complex use cases, the
   group_id could become a complex object with several fields (e.g., a
   4-tuple).  In those cases, it would be wasteful to log these values
   in full every single time.  This would also complicate tool-based
   processing. qlog allows using the "group_id" field in both
   "common_fields" and "event_fields" *at the same time* (where
   normally, a field is only allowed in one of both).  If the "group_id"
   field is present in both lists, the "group_id" value in
   "common_fields" MUST be an array of the various present group ids for
   this trace.  If this field is present, per-event "group_id" values
   are regarded as indices into the "common_fields.group_id" array.

Internet-Draft        Main logging schema for qlog            March 2020


   This is useful if the group_ids are known up-front or the qlog trace
   can be generated from a more verbose format afterwards.  If this is
   not the case, it is acceptable to just log the complex objects as the
   "group_id" for each event.  Both use cases are demonstrated in
   Figure 6 and Figure 7.

   Since "group_id" is a generic name, it conveys little of the
   semantics to the casual reader.  It is best practice to also include
   a per use case additional field to the "common_fields" with a
   semantic name, that has the same value as the "group_id" field.  For
   example, see the "ODCID" field in Figure 4 and the "four_tuples"
   field in Figure 7.

3.4.3.  category and event

   Required: event only. category is recommended.

   Both category and event are separate, generic strings.  Category
   allows a higher-level grouping of events per event type.

   For example, instead of having an event of value
   "transport_packet_sent", we instead have a category of "transport"
   and event type of "packet_sent".  This allows for fast and high-level
   filtering based on category and re-use of event across categories.

3.4.4.  data

   Required: yes

   The data field is a generic object (list of name-value pairs).  It
   contains the per-event metadata and its form and semantics are
   defined per specific sort of event (typically per event, but possibly
   also by combination of category and event).  For example data field
   value definitons for QUIC and HTTP/3, see [QLOG-QUIC-HTTP3].

3.4.5.  custom fields

   Note that qlog files can always contain custom fields (e.g., a per-
   event field indicating its privacy properties) and assign custom
   values to existing fields (e.g., new categories for implemenation-
   specific events).  Loggers are free to add such fields and field
   values and tools MUST either ignore these unknown fields or show them
   in a generic fashion.

3.4.6.  Event field values

   Required: yes

   The specific values for each of these fields and their semantics are
   defined in separate documents, specific per protocol or use case.

   For example: event definitions for QUIC and HTTP/3 can be found in
   [QLOG-QUIC-HTTP3].

3.5.  triggers

   Required: no

   Sometimes, additional information is needed in the case where a
   single event can be caused by a variety of other events.  In the
   normal case, the context of the surrounding log messages gives a hint
   as to which of these other events was the cause.  However, in highly-
   parallel and optimized implementations, corresponding log messages
   might be wide and far between in time.  Another option is to use

   triggers instead of logging extra full events to get more fine-
   grained information without much additional overhead.

   For this reason, qlog allows an optional "trigger" property on the
   value of the "data" field to convey such information.  It indicates
   the reason this event occured.  The possible reasons depend on the
   type of event and SHOULD be specified next to each event definition.
   Triggers can be of any type, but are typically logged as strings.
   For an example, see Figure 8.

4.  Tooling requirements

   Tools MUST indicate which qlog version(s) they support.
   Additionally, they SHOULD indicate exactly which values for and
   properties of the category, event and data fields they look for to
   execute their logic.  Tools SHOULD perform a (high-level) check if an
   input qlog file adheres to the expected qlog schema.  If a tool
   determines a qlog file does not contain enough supported information
   to correctly execute the tool's logic, it SHOULD generate a clear
   error message to this effect.

   Tools MUST NOT produce errors for any field names and values in the
   qlog format that they do not recognize.  Tools CAN indicate unknown
   event occurences within their context (e.g., marking unknown events
   on a timeline for manual interpretation by the user).

   Tool authors should be aware that, depending on the logging
   implementation, some events will not always be present in all traces.
   For example, using a circular logging buffer of a fixed size, it
   could be that the earliest events (e.g., connection setup events) are
   later overwritten by "newer" events.  Tool authors are encouraged to
   take this setup into account and to make their tools robust enough to
   still provide adequate output for incomplete logs.  Loggers using a
   circular buffer are in turn reminded of the requirement of listing
   events in strict time order, as er Section 3.4.1.

   Most JSON parsers strictly follow the JSON specification.  This
   includes the rule that trailing comma's are not allowed.  As it is
   frequently annoying to remove these trailing comma's when logging
   events in a streaming fashion, tool implementers SHOULD allow the
   last event entry of a qlog trace to be an empty array.  This allows
   loggers to simply close the qlog file by appending "[]]}]}" after
   their last streamed event.

5.  Methods of Access

   qlog implementers MAY make generated logs and traces on an endpoint
   (typically the server) available via the following .well-known URI:

      .well-known/log/{IDENTIFIER}

   The IDENTIFIER variable depends on the setup and the chosen protocol.
   For example, for QUIC logging, the ODCID is often used to uniquely
   identify a connection.





Marx                    Expires 22 September 2020              [Page 18]

Internet-Draft        Main logging schema for qlog            March 2020


   Implementers SHOULD allow users to fetch logs for a given connection
   on a 2nd, separate connection.  This helps prevent pollution of the
   logs by fetching them over the same connection that one wishes to
   observe through the log.  Ideally, for the QUIC use case, the logs
   should also be approachable via an HTTP/2 or HTTP/1.1 endpoint, to
   aid debugging.

   qlog implementers SHOULD NOT enable this .well-known endpoint in
   typical production settings to prevent (malicious) users from
   downloading logs from other connections.  Implementers are advised to
   disable this endpoint by default and require specific actions from
   the end users to enable it (and potentially qlog itself).

6.  Notes on Practical Use

   Note that, even with the optimizations detailed above, it is to be
   expected that qlog files (as they are JSON) will be relatively large
   when compared to binary formats.  If this turns out to be an issue in
   a real deployment, it is a perfectly acceptable practices to first
   generate the initial application-side logs in another (custom)
   (binary) format.  Afterwards, those bespoke files can then be
   transformed into the qlog format for improved interoperability with
   tools and other logs.  A prime example of this is converting of
   binary .pcap packet capture files (e.g., obtained from wireshark or
   tcpdump) to the qlog format.  Such a conversion tool is available for
   the QUIC and HTTP/3 protocols (https://github.com/quiclog/pcap2qlog).

7.  Security Considerations

   TODO : discuss privacy and security considerations (e.g., what NOT to
   log, what to strip out of a log before sharing, ...)

8.  IANA Considerations

   TODO: primarily the .well-known URI

Appendix A.  Change Log

A.1.  Since draft-marx-qlog-main-schema-00:

   *  All field names are now lowercase (e.g., category instead of
      CATEGORY)

   *  Triggers are now properties on the "data" field value, instead of
      separate field types (#23)

   *  group_ids in common_fields is now just also group_id

Appendix B.  Design Variations

   *  Quic-trace (https://github.com/google/quic-trace) takes a slightly
      different approach based on protocolbuffers.

   *  Spindump (https://github.com/EricssonResearch/spindump) also
      defines a custom text-based format for in-network measurements

   *  Wireshark (https://www.wireshark.org/) also has a QUIC dissector
      and its results can be transformed into a json output format using
      tshark.

   The idea is that qlog is able to encompass the use cases for both of
   these alternate designs and that all tooling converges on the qlog
   standard.
