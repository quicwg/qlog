1.  Introduction

   This document describes the values of the qlog name ("category" +
   "event") and "data" fields and their semantics for the HTTP/3
   protocol [HTTP3], QPACK [QPACK], and some of their extensions (see
   [EXTENDED-CONNECT], [H3_PRIORITIZATION] and [H3-DATAGRAM]).

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The event and data structure definitions in ths document are
   expressed in the Concise Data Definition Language [CDDL] and its
   extensions described in [QLOG-MAIN].

   The following fields from [QLOG-MAIN] are imported and used: name,
   category, type, data, group_id, protocol_type, importance, RawInfo,
   and time-related fields.

2.  Overview

   This document describes how the HTTP/3 and QPACK can be expressed in
   qlog using the schema defined in [QLOG-MAIN].  HTTP/3 and QPACK
   events are defined with a category, a name (the concatenation of
   "category" and "event"), an "importance", an optional "trigger", and
   "data" fields.

   Some data fields use complex datastructures.  These are represented
   as enums or re-usable definitions, which are grouped together on the
   bottom of this document for clarity.

   When any event from this document is included in a qlog trace, the
   "protocol_type" qlog array field MUST contain an entry with the value
   "HTTP3".

2.1.  Usage with QUIC

   The events described in this document can be used with or without
   logging the related QUIC events defined in [QLOG-QUIC] with
   "qlog_version" of "0.3".  If used with QUIC events, the QUIC document
   takes precedence in terms of recommended filenames and trace
   separation setups.

   If used without QUIC events, it is recommended that the
   implementation assign a globally unique identifier to each HTTP/3
   connection.  This ID can then be used as the value of the qlog
   "group_id" field, as well as the qlog filename or file identifier,
   potentially suffixed by the vantagepoint type (For example,
   abcd1234_server.qlog would contain the server-side trace of the
   connection with GUID abcd1234).

3.  HTTP/3 and QPACK Event Overview

   This document defines events in two categories, written as lowercase
   to follow convention: h3 (Section 4) and qpack (Section 6).

   As described in Section 3.4.2 of [QLOG-MAIN], the qlog "name" field
   is the concatenation of category and type.

   Table 1 summarizes the name value of each event type that is defined
   in this specification.

                     Table 1: HTTP/3 and QPACK Events

4.  HTTP/3 Events

   HTTP/3 events extend the $ProtocolEventBody extension point defined
   in [QLOG-MAIN].

   H3Events = H3ParametersSet /
              H3ParametersRestored /
              H3StreamTypeSet /
              H3PriorityUpdated /
              H3FrameCreated /
              H3FrameParsed /
              H3DatagramCreated /
              H3DatagramParsed /
              H3PushResolved

   $ProtocolEventBody /= H3Events

       Figure 1: H3Events definition and ProtocolEventBody extension

   HTTP events are logged when a certain condition happens at the
   application layer, and there isn't always a one to one mapping
   between HTTP and QUIC events.  The exchange of data between the HTTP
   and QUIC layer is logged via the "stream_data_moved" and
   "datagram_data_moved" events in [QLOG-QUIC].

4.1.  parameters_set

   Importance: Base

   This event contains HTTP/3 and QPACK-level settings, mostly those
   received from the HTTP/3 SETTINGS frame.  All these parameters are
   typically set once and never change.  However, they are typically set
   at different times during the connection, so there can be several
   instances of this event with different fields set.

   The "owner" field reflects how Settings are exchanged on a
   connection.  Sent settings have the value "local" and received
   settings have the value "received".  A qlog can have multiple
   instances of this event.

   As a reminder the CDDL unwrap operator (~), see [RFC8610]), copies
   the fields from the referenced type (H3Parameters) into the target
   type directly, extending the target with the unwrapped fields.

   Definition:

   H3ParametersSet = {
       ? owner: Owner
       ~H3Parameters

       ; qlog-specific
       ; indicates whether this implementation waits for a SETTINGS
       ; frame before processing requests
       ? waits_for_settings: bool
   }

   H3Parameters = {
       ; RFC9114
       ? max_field_section_size: uint64

       ; RFC9204
       ? max_table_capacity: uint64
       ? blocked_streams_count: uint64

       ; RFC9220 (SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL)
       ? extended_connect: uint16

       ; RFC9297 (SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM)
       ? h3_datagram: uint16

       ; additional settings for grease and extensions
       * text => uint64
   }

                    Figure 2: H3ParametersSet definition

   This event can contain any number of unspecified fields.  This allows
   for representation of reserved settings (aka GREASE) or ad-hoc
   support for extension settings that do not have a related qlog schema
   definition.

4.2.  parameters_restored

   Importance: Base

   When using QUIC 0-RTT, HTTP/3 clients are expected to remember and
   reuse the server's SETTINGs from the previous connection.  This event
   is used to indicate which HTTP/3 settings were restored and to which
   values when utilizing 0-RTT.

   Definition:

   H3ParametersRestored = {
       ~H3Parameters
   }

                 Figure 3: H3ParametersRestored definition

   Similar to H3ParametersSet this event can contain any number of
   unspecified fields to allow for reserved or extension settings.

4.3.  stream_type_set

   Importance: Base

   Emitted when a stream's type becomes known.  This is typically when a
   stream is opened and the stream's type indicator is sent or received.

   The stream_type_value field is the numerical value without VLIE
   encoding.

   Definition:

   H3StreamTypeSet = {
       ? owner: Owner
       stream_id: uint64
       stream_type: H3StreamType

       ; only when stream_type === "unknown"
       ? stream_type_value: uint64

       ; only when stream_type === "push"
       ? associated_push_id: uint64
   }

   H3StreamType =  "request" /
                     "control" /
                     "push" /
                     "reserved" /
                     "unknown" /
                     "qpack_encode" /
                     "qpack_decode"

                    Figure 4: H3StreamTypeSet definition

4.4.  priority_updated

   Importance: Base

   Emitted when the priority of a request stream or push stream is
   initialized or updated through mechanisms defined in [RFC9218].  For
   example, the priority can be updated through signals received from
   client and/or server (e.g., in HTTP/3 HEADERS or PRIORITY_UPDATE
   frames) or it can be changed or overridden due to local policies.

   Definition:

   H3PriorityUpdated = {
       ; if the prioritized element is a request stream
       ? stream_id: uint64

       ; if the prioritized element is a push stream
       ? push_id: uint64

       ? old: H3Priority
       new: H3Priority
   }

                   Figure 5: H3PriorityUpdated definition

4.5.  frame_created

   Importance: Core

   This event is emitted when the HTTP/3 framing actually happens.  This
   does not necessarily coincide with HTTP/3 data getting passed to the
   QUIC layer.  For that, see the "stream_data_moved" event in
   [QLOG-QUIC].

   Definition:

   H3FrameCreated = {
       stream_id: uint64
       ? length: uint64
       frame: $H3Frame
       ? raw: RawInfo
   }

                    Figure 6: H3FrameCreated definition

4.6.  frame_parsed

   Importance: Core

   This event is emitted when the HTTP/3 frame is parsed.  This is not
   necessarily the same as when the HTTP/3 data is actually received on
   the QUIC layer.  For that, see the "stream_data_moved" event in
   [QLOG-QUIC].

   Definition:

   H3FrameParsed = {
       stream_id: uint64
       ? length: uint64
       frame: $H3Frame
       ? raw: RawInfo
   }

                     Figure 7: H3FrameParsed definition

   HTTP/3 DATA frames can have arbitrarily large lengths to reduce frame
   header overhead.  As such, DATA frames can span multiple QUIC
   packets.  In this case, the frame_parsed event is emitted once for
   the frame header, and further streamed data is indicated using the
   stream_data_moved event.

4.7.  datagram_created

   Importance: Base

   This event is emitted when an HTTP/3 Datagram is created (see
   [RFC9297]).  This does not necessarily coincide with the HTTP/3
   Datagram getting passed to the QUIC layer.  For that, see the
   "datagram_data_moved" event in [QLOG-QUIC].

   Definition:

   H3DatagramCreated = {
       quarter_stream_id: uint64
       ? datagram: $H3Datagram
       ? raw: RawInfo
   }

                   Figure 8: H3DatagramCreated definition

4.8.  datagram_parsed

   Importance: Base

   This event is emitted when the HTTP/3 Datagram is parsed (see
   [RFC9297]).  This is not necessarily the same as when the HTTP/3
   Datagram is actually received on the QUIC layer.  For that, see the
   "datagram_data_moved" event in [QLOG-QUIC].

   Definition:

   H3DatagramParsed = {
       quarter_stream_id: uint64
       ? datagram: $H3Datagram
       ? raw: RawInfo
   }

                   Figure 9: H3DatagramParsed definition

4.9.  push_resolved

   Importance: Extra

   This event is emitted when a pushed resource is successfully claimed
   (used) or, conversely, abandoned (rejected) by the application on top
   of HTTP/3 (e.g., the web browser).  This event is added to help debug
   problems with unexpected PUSH behaviour, which is commonplace with
   HTTP/2.

   Definition:

   H3PushResolved = {
       ? push_id: uint64

       ; in case this is logged from a place that does not have access
       ; to the push_id
       ? stream_id: uint64
       decision: H3PushDecision
   }

   H3PushDecision = "claimed" /
                      "abandoned"

                    Figure 10: H3PushResolved definition

5.  HTTP/3 Data Field Definitions

   The following data field definitions can be used in HTTP/3 events.

5.1.  Owner

   Owner = "local" /
           "remote"

                        Figure 11: Owner definition

5.2.  H3Frame

   The generic $H3Frame is defined here as a CDDL extension point (a
   "socket" or "plug").  It can be extended to support additional HTTP/3
   frame types.

   ; The H3Frame is any key-value map (e.g., JSON object)
   $H3Frame /= {
       * text => any
   }

                     Figure 12: H3Frame plug definition

   The HTTP/3 frame types defined in this document are as follows:

   H3BaseFrames = H3DataFrame /
                  H3HeadersFrame /
                  H3CancelPushFrame /
                  H3SettingsFrame /
                  H3PushPromiseFrame /
                  H3GoawayFrame /
                  H3MaxPushIDFrame /
                  H3ReservedFrame /
                  H3UnknownFrame

   $H3Frame /= H3BaseFrames

                     Figure 13: H3BaseFrames definition

5.3.  H3Datagram

   The generic $H3Datagram is defined here as a CDDL extension point (a
   "socket" or "plug").  It can be extended to support additional HTTP/3
   datagram types.  This document intentionally does not define any
   specific HTTP/3 Datagram types.

   ; The H3Datagram is any key-value map (e.g., JSON object)
   $H3Datagram /= {
       * text => any
   }

                   Figure 14: H3Datagram plug definition

5.3.1.  H3DataFrame

   H3DataFrame = {
       frame_type: "data"
       ? raw: RawInfo
   }

                     Figure 15: H3DataFrame definition

5.3.2.  H3HeadersFrame

   This represents an _uncompressed_, plaintext HTTP Headers frame
   (e.g., no QPACK compression is applied).

   For example:

   headers: [
     {
       "name": ":path",
       "value": "/"
     },
     {
       "name": ":method",
       "value": "GET"
     },
     {
       "name": ":authority",

   definition in the qlog QUIC definition, see [QLOG-QUIC].

   ; ensure HTTP errors are properly validate in QUIC events as well
   ; e.g., QUIC's ConnectionClose Frame
   $ApplicationError /= H3ApplicationError

6.  QPACK Events

   QPACK events extend the $ProtocolEventBody extension point defined in
   [QLOG-MAIN].

   QPACKEvents = QPACKStateUpdate /
                 QPACKStreamStateUpdate /
                 QPACKDynamicTableUpdate /
                 QPACKHeadersEncoded /
                 QPACKHeadersDecoded /
                 QPACKInstructionCreated /
                 QPACKInstructionParsed

   $ProtocolEventBody /= QPACKEvents

     Figure 28: QPACKEvents definition and ProtocolEventBody extension

   QPACK events mainly serve as an aid to debug low-level QPACK
   issues.The higher-level, plaintext header values SHOULD (also) be
   logged in the http.frame_created and http.frame_parsed event data
   (instead).

   QPACK does not have its own parameters_set event.  This was merged
   with http.parameters_set for brevity, since qpack is a required
   extension for HTTP/3 anyway.  Other HTTP/3 extensions MAY also log
   their SETTINGS fields in http.parameters_set or MAY define their own
   events.

6.1.  state_updated

   Importance: Base

   This event is emitted when one or more of the internal QPACK
   variables changes value.  Note that some variables have two
   variations (one set locally, one requested by the remote peer).  This
   is reflected in the "owner" field.  As such, this field MUST be
   correct for all variables included a single event instance.  If you
   need to log settings from two sides, you MUST emit two separate event
   instances.

   Definition:

   QPACKStateUpdate = {
       owner: Owner
       ? dynamic_table_capacity: uint64

       ; effective current size, sum of all the entries
       ? dynamic_table_size: uint64
       ? known_received_count: uint64
       ? current_insert_count: uint64
   }

                   Figure 29: QPACKStateUpdate definition

6.2.  stream_state_updated

   Importance: Core

   This event is emitted when a stream becomes blocked or unblocked by
   header decoding requests or QPACK instructions.

   This event is of "Core" importance, as it might have a large impact
   on HTTP/3's observed performance.

   Definition:

   QPACKStreamStateUpdate = {
       stream_id: uint64

       ; streams are assumed to start "unblocked"
       ; until they become "blocked"
       state: QPACKStreamState
   }

   QPACKStreamState = "blocked" /
                      "unblocked"

                Figure 30: QPACKStreamStateUpdate definition

6.3.  dynamic_table_updated

   Importance: Extra

   This event is emitted when one or more entries are inserted or
   evicted from QPACK's dynamic table.

   Definition:

   QPACKDynamicTableUpdate = {

       ; local = the encoder's dynamic table
       ; remote = the decoder's dynamic table
       owner: Owner
       update_type: QPACKDynamicTableUpdateType
       entries: [+ QPACKDynamicTableEntry]
   }

   QPACKDynamicTableUpdateType = "inserted" /
                                 "evicted"

   QPACKDynamicTableEntry = {
       index: uint64
       ? name: text /
               hexstring
       ? value: text /
                hexstring
   }

               Figure 31: QPACKDynamicTableUpdate definition

6.4.  headers_encoded

   Importance: Base

   This event is emitted when an uncompressed header block is encoded
   successfully.

   This event has overlap with http.frame_created for the HeadersFrame
   type.  When outputting both events, implementers MAY omit the
   "headers" field in this event.

   Definition:

   QPACKHeadersEncoded = {
       ? stream_id: uint64
       ? headers: [+ H3HTTPField]
       block_prefix: QPACKHeaderBlockPrefix
       header_block: [+ QPACKHeaderBlockRepresentation]
       ? raw: RawInfo
   }

                 Figure 32: QPACKHeadersEncoded definition

6.5.  headers_decoded

   Importance: Base

   This event is emitted when a compressed header block is decoded
   successfully.

   This event has overlap with http.frame_parsed for the HeadersFrame
   type.  When outputting both events, implementers MAY omit the
   "headers" field in this event.

   Definition:

   QPACKHeadersDecoded = {
       ? stream_id: uint64
       ? headers: [+ H3HTTPField]
       block_prefix: QPACKHeaderBlockPrefix
       header_block: [+ QPACKHeaderBlockRepresentation]
       ? raw: RawInfo
   }

                 Figure 33: QPACKHeadersDecoded definition

6.6.  instruction_created

   Importance: Base

   This event is emitted when a QPACK instruction (both decoder and
   encoder) is created and added to the encoder/decoder stream.

   Definition:

   QPACKInstructionCreated = {

       ; see definition in appendix
       instruction: QPACKInstruction
       ? raw: RawInfo
   }

               Figure 34: QPACKInstructionCreated definition

   Encoder/decoder semantics and stream_id's are implicit in either the
   instruction types or can be logged via other events (e.g.,
   http.stream_type_set)

6.7.  instruction_parsed

   Importance: Base

   This event is emitted when a QPACK instruction (both decoder and
   encoder) is read from the encoder/decoder stream.

   Definition:

   QPACKInstructionParsed = {

       ; see QPACKInstruction definition in appendix
       instruction: QPACKInstruction
       ? raw: RawInfo
   }

                Figure 35: QPACKInstructionParsed definition

   Encoder/decoder semantics and stream_id's are implicit in either the
   instruction types or can be logged via other events (e.g.,
   http.stream_type_set)

7.  QPACK Data Field Definitions

   The following data field definitions can be used in QPACK events.

7.1.  QPACKInstruction

   The instructions do not have explicit encoder/decoder types, since
   there is no overlap between the instructions of both types in neither
   name nor function.

   QPACKInstruction = SetDynamicTableCapacityInstruction /
                      InsertWithNameReferenceInstruction /

   *  Renamed HTTPStreamType data to request (#222)

   *  Added HTTPStreamType value unknown (#227)

   *  Added HTTPUnknownFrame (#224)

   *  Moved data definitions out of the appendix into separate sections

   *  Added overview Table of Contents

A.4.  Since draft-ietf-quic-qlog-h3-events-01:

   *  No changes - new draft to prevent expiration

A.5.  Since draft-ietf-quic-qlog-h3-events-00:

   *  Change the data definition language from TypeScript to CDDL (#143)

A.6.  Since draft-marx-qlog-event-definitions-quic-h3-02:

   *  These changes were done in preparation of the adoption of the
      drafts by the QUIC working group (#137)

   *  Split QUIC and HTTP/3 events into two separate documents

   *  Moved RawInfo, Importance, Generic events and Simulation events to
      the main schema document.

A.7.  Since draft-marx-qlog-event-definitions-quic-h3-01:

   Major changes:

   *  Moved data_moved from http to transport.  Also made the "from" and
      "to" fields flexible strings instead of an enum (#111,#65)

   *  Moved packet_type fields to PacketHeader.  Moved packet_size field
      out of PacketHeader to RawInfo:length (#40)

   *  Made events that need to log packet_type and packet_number use a
      header field instead of logging these fields individually

   *  Added support for logging retry, stateless reset and initial
      tokens (#94,#86,#117)

   *  Moved separate general event categories into a single category
      "generic" (#47)

   *  Added "transport:connection_closed" event (#43,#85,#78,#49)

   *  Added version_information and alpn_information events
      (#85,#75,#28)

   *  Added parameters_restored events to help clarify 0-RTT behaviour
      (#88)

   Smaller changes:

   *  Merged loss_timer events into one loss_timer_updated event

   *  Field data types are now strongly defined (#10,#39,#36,#115)

   *  Renamed qpack instruction_received and instruction_sent to
      instruction_created and instruction_parsed (#114)

   *  Updated qpack:dynamic_table_updated.update_type.  It now has the
      value "inserted" instead of "added" (#113)

   *  Updated qpack:dynamic_table_updated.  It now has an "owner" field
      to differentiate encoder vs decoder state (#112)

   *  Removed push_allowed from http:parameters_set (#110)

   *  Removed explicit trigger field indications from events, since this
      was moved to be a generic property of the "data" field (#80)

   *  Updated transport:connection_id_updated to be more in line with
      other similar events.  Also dropped importance from Core to Base
      (#45)

   *  Added length property to PaddingFrame (#34)

   *  Added packet_number field to transport:frames_processed (#74)

   *  Added a way to generically log packet header flags (first 8 bits)
      to PacketHeader

   *  Added additional guidance on which events to log in which
      situations (#53)

   *  Added "simulation:scenario" event to help indicate simulation
      details

   *  Added "packets_acked" event (#107)

   *  Added "datagram_ids" to the datagram_X and packet_X events to
      allow tracking of coalesced QUIC packets (#91)

   *  Extended connection_state_updated with more fine-grained states
      (#49)

A.8.  Since draft-marx-qlog-event-definitions-quic-h3-00:

   *  Event and category names are now all lowercase

   *  Added many new events and their definitions

   *  "type" fields have been made more specific (especially important
      for PacketType fields, which are now called packet_type instead of
      type)

   *  Events are given an importance indicator (issue #22)

   *  Event names are more consistent and use past tense (issue #21)

   *  Triggers have been redefined as properties of the "data" field and
      updated for most events (issue #23)
