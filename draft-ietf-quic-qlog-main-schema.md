--- abstract

This document defines qlog, an extensible high-level schema for a standardized
logging format. It allows easy sharing of data, benefitting common debug and
analysis methods and tooling. The high-level schema is independent of protocol;
separate documents extend qlog for protocol-specific data. The schema is also
independent of serialization format, allowing logs to be represented in many
ways such as JSON, CSV, or protobuf.

# Introduction

Endpoint logging is a useful strategy for capturing and understanding how
applications using network protocols are behaving, particularly where protocols
have an encrypted wire image that restricts observers' ability to see what is
happening.

Many applications implement logging using a custom, non-standard logging format.
This has an effect on the tools and methods that are used to
analyze the logs, for example to perform root cause analysis of an
interoperability failure between distinct implementations. A lack of a common
format impedes the development of common tooling that can be used by all parties
that have access to logs.

This document defines qlog, an extensible high-level schema and harness that
provides a shareable, aggregatable and structured logging format. This
high-level schema is independent of protocol, with logging entries for specific
protocols and use cases being defined in other documents (see for example
{{QLOG-QUIC}} for QUIC and {{QLOG-H3}} for HTTP/3 and QPACK-related event
definitions).

The goal of this high-level schema is to provide amenities and default
characteristics that each logging file should contain (or should be able to
contain), such that generic and reusable toolsets can be created that can deal
with logs from a variety of different protocols and use cases.

As such, qlog provides versioning, metadata inclusion, log aggregation, event
grouping and log file size reduction techniques.

The qlog schema can be serialized in many ways (e.g., JSON, CBOR, protobuf,
etc). This document describes only how to employ {{!JSON=RFC8259}}, its subset
{{!I-JSON=RFC7493}}, and its streamable derivative
{{!JSON-Text-Sequences=RFC7464}}.



## Notational Conventions {#data_types}

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

### Schema definition

To define events and data structures, all qlog documents use the Concise
Data Definition Language {{!CDDL=RFC8610}}. This document uses the basic
syntax, the specific `text`, `uint`, `float32`, `float64`, `bool`, and
`any` types, as well as the `.default`, `.size`, and `.regexp` control
operators, the `~` unwrapping operator, and the `$` extension point
syntax from {{CDDL}}.

Additionally, this document defines the following custom types for
clarity:

~~~ cddl
; CDDL's uint is defined as being 64-bit in size
; but for many protocol fields it is better to be restrictive
; and explicit
uint8 = uint .size 1
uint16 = uint .size 2
uint32 = uint .size 4
uint64 = uint .size 8

; an even-length lowercase string of hexadecimally encoded bytes
; examples: 82dc, 027339, 4cdbfd9bf0
; this is needed because the default CDDL binary string (bytes/bstr)
; is only CBOR and not JSON compatible
hexstring = text .regexp "([0-9a-f]{2})*"
~~~
{: #cddl-custom-types-def title="Additional CDDL type definitions"}

All timestamps and time-related values (e.g., offsets) in qlog are
logged as `float64` in the millisecond resolution.

Other qlog documents can define their own CDDL-compatible (struct) types
(e.g., separately for each Packet type that a protocol supports).

> Note to RFC editor: Please remove the following text in this section before
publication.

The main general CDDL syntax conventions in this document a reader
should be aware of for easy reading comprehension are:

* `? obj` : this object is optional
* `TypeName1 / TypeName2` : a union of these two types (object can be either type 1 OR
  type 2)
* `obj: TypeName` : this object has this concrete type
* `obj: [* TypeName]` : this object is an array of this type with
  minimum size of 0 elements
* `obj: [+ TypeName]` : this object is an array of this type with
  minimum size of 1 element
* `TypeName = ...` : defines a new type
* `EnumName = "entry1" / "entry2" / entry3 / ...`: defines an enum
* `StructName = { ... }` : defines a new struct type
* `;` : single-line comment
* `* text => any` : special syntax to indicate 0 or more fields that
  have a string key that maps to any value. Used to indicate a generic
  JSON object.

All timestamps and time-related values (e.g., offsets) in qlog are
logged as `float64` in the millisecond resolution.

Other qlog documents can define their own CDDL-compatible (struct) types
(e.g., separately for each Packet type that a protocol supports).

### Serialization examples

Serialization examples in this document use JSON ({{!JSON=RFC8259}}) unless
otherwise indicated.

# Design goals

The main tenets for the qlog schema design are:

* Streamable, event-based logging
* A flexible format that can reduce log producer overhead, at the cost of
  increased complexity for consumers (e.g. tools)
* Extensible and pragmatic
* Aggregation and transformation friendly (e.g., the top-level element
  for the non-streaming format is a container for individual traces,
  group_ids can be used to tag events to a particular context)
* Metadata is stored together with event data


# QlogFile schema {#qlog-file-schema}

A qlog using the QlogFile schema can contain several individual traces and logs
from multiple vantage points that are in some way related. The top-level element
in this schema defines only a small set of "header" fields and an array of
component traces, defined in {{qlog-file-def}} as:

~~~ cddl
QlogFile = {
    qlog_version: text
    ? qlog_format: text .default "JSON"
    ? title: text
    ? description: text
    ? traces: [+ Trace /
                 TraceError]
}
~~~
{: #qlog-file-def title="QlogFile definition"}

The required "qlog_version" field MUST have the value "0.4".

The optional "qlog_format" field indicates the serialization format. Its value
MUST either be one of the options defined in this document (i.e.,
{{concrete-formats}}) or the field MUST be omitted entirely. When the field is
omitted the default value of "JSON" applies.

The optional "title" and "description" fields provide additional free-text
information about the file.

The optional "traces" field contains an array of qlog traces ({{trace}}), each
of which contain metadata and an array of qlog events ({{events}}).

In order to make it easier to parse and identify qlog files and their
serialization format, the "qlog_version" and "qlog_format" fields and their
values SHOULD be in the first 256 characters/bytes of the resulting log file.

Where a qlog file is serialized to a JSON format, one of the downsides is that
it is inherently a non-streamable format. Put differently, it is not possible to
simply append new qlog events to a log file without "closing" this file at the
end by appending "]}]}". Without these closing tags, most JSON parsers will be
unable to parse the file entirely. The alternative QlogFileSeq
({{qlog-file-seq-schema}}) is better suited to streaming.

JSON serialization example:

~~~
{
    "qlog_version": "0.4",
    "qlog_format": "JSON",
    "title": "Name of this particular qlog file (short)",
    "description": "Description for this group of traces (long)",
    "traces": [...]
}
~~~
{: #qlog-file-ex title="QlogFile example"}

## Traces

It can be advantageous to group several related qlog traces together in a single
file. For example, it is possible to simultaneously perform logging on the
client, on the server, and on a single point on their common network path. For
analysis, it is useful to aggregate these three individual traces together into
a single file, so it can be uniquely stored, transferred, and annotated.

The QlogFile "traces" field is an array that contains a list of individual qlog
traces. When capturing a qlog at a vantage point, it is expected that the traces
field contains a single entry. Files can be aggregated, for example as part of a
post-processing operation, by copying the traces in component to files into the
combined "traces" array of a new, aggregated qlog file.

## Trace {#trace}

The exact conceptual definition of a Trace can be fluid. For example, a trace
could contain all events for a single connection, for a single endpoint, for a
single measurement interval, for a single protocol, etc. In the normal use case
however, a trace is a log of a single data flow collected at a single location
or vantage point. For example, for QUIC, a single trace only contains events for
a single logical QUIC connection for either the client or the server.

A Trace contains some metadata in addition to qlog events, defined in
{{trace-def}} as:

~~~ cddl
Trace = {
    ? title: text
    ? description: text
    ? common_fields: CommonFields
    ? vantage_point: VantagePoint
    events: [* Event]
}
~~~
{: #trace-def title="Trace definition"}

The optional "title" and "description" fields provide additional free-text
information about the trace.

The optional "common_fields" field is described in {{common-fields}}.

The optional "vantage_point" field is described in {{vantage-point}}.

The semantics and context of the trace can mainly be deduced from the entries in
the "common_fields" list and "vantage_point" field.

JSON serialization example:

~~~~~~~~
{
    "title": "Name of this particular trace (short)",
    "description": "Description for this trace (long)",
    "common_fields": {
        "ODCID": "abcde1234",
        "time_format": "absolute"
    },
    "vantage_point": {
        "name": "backend-67",
        "type": "server"
    },
    "events": [...]
}
~~~~~~~~
{: #trace-ex title="Trace example"}

## TraceError

A TraceError indicates that an attempt to find/convert a file for inclusion in
the aggregated qlog was made, but there was an error during the process. Rather
than silently dropping the erroneous file, it can be explicitly included in the
qlog file as an entry in the "traces" array, defined in {{trace-error-def}} as:

~~~ cddl
TraceError = {
    error_description: text

    ; the original URI used for attempted find of the file
    ? uri: text
    ? vantage_point: VantagePoint
}
~~~
{: #trace-error-def title="TraceError definition"}

JSON serialization example:

~~~~~~~
{
    "error_description": "File could not be found",
    "uri": "/srv/traces/today/latest.qlog",
    "vantage_point": { type: "server" }
}
~~~~~~~
{: #trace-error-ex title="TraceError example"}

Note that another way to combine events of different traces in a single qlog file
is through the use of the "group_id" field, discussed in {{group-ids}}.

# QlogFileSeq schema {#qlog-file-seq-schema}

A qlog file using the QlogFileSeq schema can be serialized to a streamable JSON
format called JSON Text Sequences (JSON-SEQ) ({{!RFC7464}}). The top-level
element in this schema defines only a small set of "header" fields and an array
of component traces, defined in {{qlog-file-def}} as:

~~~ cddl
QlogFileSeq = {
    qlog_format: "JSON-SEQ"
    qlog_version: text
    ? title: text
    ? description: text
    trace: TraceSeq
}
~~~
{: #qlog-file-seq-def title="QlogFileSeq definition"}

The required "qlog_format" field MUST have the value "JSON-SEQ".

The required "qlog_version" field MUST have the value "0.4".

The optional "title" and "description" fields provide additional free-text
information about the file.

The optional "trace" field contains a singular trace metadata. All qlog events
in the file are related to this trace.

JSON-SEQ serialization example:

~~~~~~~~
// list of qlog events, serialized in accordance with RFC 7464,
// starting with a Record Separator character and ending with a
// newline.
// For display purposes, Record Separators are rendered as <RS>

<RS>{
    "qlog_version": "0.4",
    "qlog_format": "JSON-SEQ",
    "title": "Name of JSON Text Sequence qlog file (short)",
    "description": "Description for this trace file (long)",
    "trace": {
      "common_fields": {
        "protocol_type": ["QUIC","HTTP3"],
        "group_id":"127ecc830d98f9d54a42c4f0842aa87e181a",
        "time_format":"relative",
        "reference_time": 1553986553572
      },
      "vantage_point": {
        "name":"backend-67",
        "type":"server"
      }
    }
}
<RS>{"time": 2, "name": "quic:parameters_set", "data": { ... } }
<RS>{"time": 7, "name": "quic:packet_sent", "data": { ... } }
...
~~~~~~~~
{: #json-seq-ex title="Top-level element"}

For further information about serialization, see {{format-json-seq}}.

## TraceSeq

TraceSeq is used with QlogFileSeq. It is conceptually similar to a Trace, with
the exception that qlog events are not contained within it, but rather appended
after it in a QlogFileSeq.

~~~ cddl
TraceSeq = {
    ? title: text
    ? description: text
    ? common_fields: CommonFields
    ? vantage_point: VantagePoint
}
~~~
{: #trace-seq-def title="TraceSeq definition"}

# VantagePoint {#vantage-point}

A VantagePoint describes the vantage point from which a trace originates,
defined in {{vantage-point-def}} as:

~~~ cddl
VantagePoint = {
    ? name: text
    type: VantagePointType
    ? flow: VantagePointType
}

; client = endpoint which initiates the connection
; server = endpoint which accepts the connection
; network = observer in between client and server
VantagePointType = "client" /
                   "server" /
                   "network" /
                   "unknown"
~~~
{: #vantage-point-def title="VantagePoint definition"}

JSON serialization examples:

~~~~~~~~
{
    "name": "aioquic client",
    "type": "client"
}

{
    "name": "wireshark trace",
    "type": "network",
    "flow": "client"
}
~~~~~~~~
{: #vantage-point-ex title="VantagePoint example"}

The flow field is only required if the type is "network" (for example, the trace
is generated from a packet capture). It is used to disambiguate events like
"packet sent" and "packet received". This is indicated explicitly because for
multiple reasons (e.g., privacy) data from which the flow direction can be
otherwise inferred (e.g., IP addresses) might not be present in the logs.

Meaning of the different values for the flow field:
  * "client" indicates that this vantage point follows client data flow semantics (a
    "packet sent" event goes in the direction of the server).
  * "server" indicates that this vantage point follow server data flow semantics (a
    "packet sent" event goes in the direction of the client).
  * "unknown" indicates that the flow's direction is unknown.

Depending on the context, tools confronted with "unknown" values in the
vantage_point can either try to heuristically infer the semantics from
protocol-level domain knowledge (e.g., in QUIC, the client always sends the first
packet) or give the user the option to switch between client and server
perspectives manually.

# Events {#events}

A qlog event is specified as a generic object with a number of member
fields and their associated data. Depending on the protocol and use case, the
exact member field names and their formats can differ across implementations. This
section lists the main, pre-defined and reserved field names with specific
semantics and expected corresponding value formats.

An Event is defined in {{event-def}} as:

~~~ cddl
Event = {
    time: float64
    name: text
    data: $ProtocolEventBody
    ? time_format: TimeFormat
    ? protocol_type: ProtocolType
    ? group_id: GroupID
    ? system_info: SystemInformation

    ; events can contain any amount of custom fields
    * text => any
}
~~~
{: #event-def title="Event definition"}

Each qlog event MUST contain the mandatory fields: "time"
({{time-based-fields}}), "name" ({{name-field}}), and "data" ({{data-field}}).

Each qlog event MAY contain the optional fields: "time_format"
({{time-based-fields}}), "protocol_type" ({{protocol-type-field}}), "trigger"
({{trigger-field}}), and "group_id" ({{group-ids}}).

Multiple events can appear in a Trace or TraceSeq and they might contain fields
with identical values. It is possible to optimize out this duplication using
"common_fields" ({{common-fields}}).

The specific values for each of these fields and their semantics are defined in
separate documents, depending on protocol or use case. For example: event
definitions for QUIC, HTTP/3 and QPACK can be found in {{QLOG-QUIC}} and
{{QLOG-H3}}.

Events are intended to be extended with custom fields, therefore they MAY
contain other fields not defined in this document. Custom fields may be known or
unknown to tools. Tools SHOULD allow for the presence of unknown event fields,
but their semantics depend on the context of the log usage.

JSON serialization:

~~~~~~~~
{
    "time": 1553986553572,

    "name": "quic:packet_sent",
    "data": { ... },

    "protocol_type":  ["QUIC","HTTP3"],
    "group_id": "127ecc830d98f9d54a42c4f0842aa87e181a",

    "time_format": "absolute",

    "ODCID": "127ecc830d98f9d54a42c4f0842aa87e181a"
}
~~~~~~~~
{: #event-ex title="Event example"}

## Timestamps {#time-based-fields}

An event's "time" field indicates the timestamp at which the event occurred. Its value is
typically the Unix timestamp since the 1970 epoch (number of milliseconds since
midnight UTC, January 1, 1970, ignoring leap seconds). However, qlog supports two
more succinct timestamps formats to allow reducing file size. The employed format
is indicated in the "time_format" field, which allows one of three values:
"absolute", "delta" or "relative".

~~~ cddl
TimeFormat = "absolute" /
             "delta" /
             "relative"
~~~
{: #time-format-def title="TimeFormat definition"}

* Absolute: Include the full absolute timestamp with each event. This approach
  uses the largest amount of characters. This is also the default value of the
  "time_format" field.
* Delta: Delta-encode each time value on the previously logged value. The first
  event in a trace typically logs the full absolute timestamp. This approach uses
  the least amount of characters.
* Relative: Specify a full "reference_time" timestamp (typically this is done
  up-front in "common_fields", see {{common-fields}}) and include only
  relatively-encoded values based on this reference_time with each event. The
  "reference_time" value is typically the first absolute timestamp. This approach
  uses a medium amount of characters.

The first option is good for stateless loggers, the second and third for stateful
loggers. The third option is generally preferred, since it produces smaller files
while being easier to reason about. An example for each option can be seen in
{{time-format-ex}}.

~~~~~~~~
The absolute approach will use:
1500, 1505, 1522, 1588

The delta approach will use:
1500, 5, 17, 66

The relative approach will:
- set the reference_time to 1500 in "common_fields"
- use: 0, 5, 22, 88
~~~~~~~~
{: #time-format-ex title="Three different approaches for logging timestamps"}

One of these options is typically chosen for the entire trace (put differently:
each event has the same value for the "time_format" field). Each event MUST
include a timestamp in the "time" field.

Events in each individual trace SHOULD be logged in strictly ascending timestamp
order (though not necessarily absolute value, for the "delta" format). Tools MAY
sort all events on the timestamp before processing them, though are not required
to (as this could impose a significant processing overhead). This can be a problem
especially for multi-threaded and/or streaming loggers, who could consider using a
separate post-processor to order qlog events in time if a tool do not provide this
feature.

Timestamps do not have to use the UNIX epoch timestamp as their reference. For
example for privacy considerations, any initial reference timestamps (for example
"endpoint uptime in ms" or "time since connection start in ms") can be chosen.
Tools SHOULD NOT assume the ability to derive the absolute Unix timestamp from
qlog traces, nor allow on them to relatively order events across two or more
separate traces (in this case, clock drift should also be taken into account).

## Names {#name-field}

Events differ mainly in the type of metadata associated with them. The "name"
field is an identifier that parsers can use to decide how to interpret the event
metadata contained in the "data" field (see {{data-field}}).

Event names indicate a category and type. The "name" field MUST contain a
non-empty character sequence representing a category, followed by a colon (':'),
followed by a non-empty character sequence representing a type.

Category allows a higher-level grouping of events per specific event type. For
example for QUIC and HTTP/3, the different categories could be "quic", "http",
"qpack", and "recovery". Within these categories, the event type provides
additional granularity. For example for QUIC and HTTP/3, within the "quic"
category, there would be "packet_sent" and "packet_received" events.

JSON serialization example:

~~~
{
    "name": "quic:packet_sent"
}
~~~
{: #name-ex title="An event with category \"quic\" and type \"packet_sent\"."}

## Data {#data-field}

An event's "data" field is a generic object. It contains the per-event metadata and its
form and semantics are defined per specific sort of event. For example, data
field value definitions for QUIC and HTTP/3 can be found in {{QLOG-QUIC}} and
{{QLOG-H3}}.

This field is defined here as a CDDL extension point (a "socket" or
"plug") named `$ProtocolEventBody`. Other documents MUST properly extend
this extension point when defining new data field content options to
enable automated validation of aggregated qlog schemas.

The only common field defined for the data field is the `trigger` field,
which is discussed in {{trigger-field}}.

~~~ cddl
; The ProtocolEventBody is any key-value map (e.g., JSON object)
; only the optional trigger field is defined in this document
$ProtocolEventBody /= {
    ? trigger: text
    * text => any
}
; event documents are intended to extend this socket by using:
; NewProtocolEvents = EventType1 /
;                     EventType2 /
;                     ... /
;                     EventTypeN
; $ProtocolEventBody /= NewProtocolEvents
~~~
{: #protocoleventbody-def title="ProtocolEventBody definition"}

One purely illustrative example for a QUIC "packet_sent" event is shown in
{{data-ex}}:

~~~~~~~~
TransportPacketSent = {
    ? packet_size: uint16
    header: PacketHeader
    ? frames:[* QuicFrame]
    ? trigger: "pto_probe" /
               "retransmit_timeout" /
               "bandwidth_probe"
}

could be serialized as

{
    "packet_size": 1280,
    "header": {
        "packet_type": "1RTT",
        "packet_number": 123
    },
    "frames": [
        {
            "frame_type": "stream",
            "length": 1000,
            "offset": 456
        },
        {
            "frame_type": "padding"
        }
    ]
}
~~~~~~~~
{: #data-ex title="Example of the 'data' field for a QUIC packet_sent event"}

## ProtocolType {#protocol-type-field}

An event's "protocol_type" array field indicates to which protocols (or protocol
"stacks") this event belongs. This allows a single qlog file to aggregate traces
of different protocols (e.g., a web server offering both TCP+HTTP/2 and
QUIC+HTTP/3 connections).

~~~ cddl
ProtocolType = [+ text]
~~~
{: #protocol-type-def title="ProtocolType definition"}

For example, QUIC and HTTP/3 events have the "QUIC" and "HTTP3" protocol_type
entry values, see {{QLOG-QUIC}} and {{QLOG-H3}}.

Typically however, all events in a single trace are of the same few protocols, and
this array field is logged once in "common_fields", see {{common-fields}}.

## Triggers {#trigger-field}

Sometimes, additional information is needed in the case where a single event can
be caused by a variety of other events. In the normal case, the context of the
surrounding log messages gives a hint as to which of these other events was the
cause. However, in highly-parallel and optimized implementations, corresponding
log messages might separated in time. Another option is to explicitly indicate
these "triggers" in a high-level way per-event to get more fine-grained
information without much additional overhead.

In qlog, the optional "trigger" field contains a string value describing
the reason (if any) for this event instance occurring, see
{{data-field}}. While this "trigger" field could be a property of the
qlog Event itself, it is instead a property of the "data" field instead.
This choice was made because many event types do not include a trigger
value, and having the field at the Event-level would cause overhead in
some serializations. Additional information on the trigger can be added
in the form of additional member fields of the "data" field value, yet
this is highly implementation-specific, as are the trigger field's
string values.

One purely illustrative example of some potential triggers for QUIC's
"packet_dropped" event is shown in {{trigger-ex}}:

~~~~~~~~
TransportPacketDropped = {
    ? packet_type: PacketType
    ? raw_length: uint16
    ? trigger: "key_unavailable" /
               "unknown_connection_id" /
               "decrypt_error" /
               "unsupported_version"
}
~~~~~~~~
{: #trigger-ex title="Trigger example"}

## Grouping {#group-ids}

As discussed in {{trace}}, a single qlog file can contain several traces taken
from different vantage points. However, a single trace from one endpoint can also
contain events from a variety of sources. For example, a server implementation
might choose to log events for all incoming connections in a single large
(streamed) qlog file. As such, a method for splitting up events belonging
to separate logical entities is required.

The simplest way to perform this splitting is by associating a "group id"
to each event that indicates to which conceptual "group" each event belongs. A
post-processing step can then extract events per group. However, this group
identifier can be highly protocol and context-specific. In the example above,
the QUIC "Original Destination Connection ID" could be used to uniquely identify a
connection. As such, they might add a "ODCID" field to each event. However, a
middlebox logging IP or TCP traffic might rather use four-tuples to identify
connections, and add a "four_tuple" field.

As such, to provide consistency and ease of tooling in cross-protocol and
cross-context setups, qlog instead defines the common "group_id" field, which
contains a string value. Implementations are free to use their preferred string
serialization for this field, so long as it contains a unique value per logical
group. Some examples can be seen in {{group-id-ex}}.

~~~ cddl
GroupID = text
~~~
{: #group-id-def title="GroupID definition"}

JSON serialization example for events grouped by four tuples
and QUIC connection IDs:

~~~~~~~~
"events": [
    {
        "time": 1553986553579,
        "protocol_type": ["TCP", "TLS", "HTTP2"],
        "group_id": "ip1=2001:67c:1232:144:9498:6df6:f450:110b,
                   ip2=2001:67c:2b0:1c1::198,port1=59105,port2=80",
        "name": "quic:packet_received",
        "data": { ... }
    },
    {
        "time": 1553986553581,
        "protocol_type": ["QUIC","HTTP3"],
        "group_id": "127ecc830d98f9d54a42c4f0842aa87e181a",
        "name": "quic:packet_sent",
        "data": { ... }
    }
]
~~~~~~~~
{: #group-id-ex title="GroupID example"}

Note that in some contexts (for example a Multipath transport protocol) it might
make sense to add additional contextual per-event fields (for example "path_id"),
rather than use the group_id field for that purpose.

Note also that, typically, a single trace only contains events belonging to a
single logical group (for example, an individual QUIC connection). As such,
instead of logging the "group_id" field with an identical value for each event
instance, this field is typically logged once in "common_fields", see
{{common-fields}}.

## SystemInformation

The "system_info" field can be used to record system-specific details related to an
event. This is useful, for instance, where an application splits work across
CPUs, processes, or threads and events for a single trace occur on potentially
different combinations thereof. Each field is optional to support deployment
diversity.

~~~ cddl
SystemInformation = {
  ? processor_id: uint32
  ? process_id: uint32
  ? thread_id: uint32
}
~~~

## CommonFields {#common-fields}

As discussed in the previous sections, information for a typical qlog event varies
in three main fields: "time", "name" and associated data. Additionally, there are
also several more advanced fields that allow mixing events from different
protocols and contexts inside of the same trace (for example "protocol_type" and
"group_id"). In most "normal" use cases however, the values of these advanced
fields are consistent for each event instance (for example, a single trace
contains events for a single QUIC connection).

To reduce file size and making logging easier, qlog uses the "common_fields" list
to indicate those fields and their values that are shared by all events in this
component trace. This prevents these fields from being logged for each individual
event. An example of this is shown in {{common-fields-ex}}.

~~~~~~~~
JSON serialization with repeated field values
per-event instance:

{
    "events": [{
            "group_id": "127ecc830d98f9d54a42c4f0842aa87e181a",
            "protocol_type": ["QUIC","HTTP3"],
            "time_format": "relative",
            "reference_time": 1553986553572,

            "time": 2,
            "name": "quic:packet_received",
            "data": { ... }
        },{
            "group_id": "127ecc830d98f9d54a42c4f0842aa87e181a",

            "time": 7,
            "name": "http:frame_parsed",
            "data": { ... }
        }
    ]
}

JSON serialization with repeated field values instead
extracted to common_fields:

{
    "common_fields": {
        "group_id": "127ecc830d98f9d54a42c4f0842aa87e181a",
        "protocol_type": ["QUIC","HTTP3"],
        "time_format": "relative",
        "reference_time": 1553986553572
    },
    "events": [
        {
            "time": 2,
            "name": "quic:packet_received",
            "data": { ... }
        },{
            "time": 7,
            "name": "http:frame_parsed",
            "data": { ... }
        }
    ]
}
~~~~~~~~
{: #common-fields-ex title="CommonFields example"}

An event's "common_fields" field is a generic dictionary of key-value pairs, where the
key is always a string and the value can be of any type, but is typically also a
string or number. As such, unknown entries in this dictionary MUST be disregarded
by the user and tools (i.e., the presence of an unknown field is explicitly NOT an
error).

The list of default qlog fields that are typically logged in common_fields (as
opposed to as individual fields per event instance) are shown in the listing
below:

~~~ cddl
CommonFields = {
    ? time_format: TimeFormat
    ? reference_time: float64
    ? protocol_type: ProtocolType
    ? group_id: GroupID
    * text => any
}
~~~
{: #common-fields-def title="CommonFields definition"}

Tools MUST be able to deal with these fields being defined either on each event
individually or combined in common_fields. Note that if at least one event in a
trace has a different value for a given field, this field MUST NOT be added to
common_fields but instead defined on each event individually. Good example of such
fields are "time" and "data", who are divergent by nature.

# Raw packet and frame information {#raw-info}

While qlog is a high-level logging format, it also allows the inclusion of most
raw wire image information, such as byte lengths and byte values. This is useful
when for example investigating or tuning packetization behavior or determining
encoding/framing overheads. However, these fields are not always necessary, can
take up considerable space, and can have a considerable privacy and security
impact (see {{privacy}}). Where applicable, these fields are grouped in a
separate, optional, field named "raw" of type RawInfo. The exact definition of
entities, headers, trailers and payloads depend on the protocol used.

~~~ cddl
RawInfo = {

    ; the full byte length of the entity (e.g., packet or frame),
    ; including possible headers and trailers
    ? length: uint64

    ; the byte length of the entity's payload,
    ; excluding possible headers or trailers
    ? payload_length: uint64

    ; the (potentially truncated) contents of the full entity,
    ; including headers and possibly trailers
    ? data: hexstring
}
~~~
{: #raw-info-def title="RawInfo definition"}

The RawInfo:data field can be truncated for privacy or security purposes, see
{{truncated-values}}. In this case, the length and payload_length fields should
still indicate the non-truncated lengths when used for debugging purposes.

This document does not specify explicit header_length or trailer_length fields.
In protocols without trailers, header_length can be calculated by subtracting
the payload_length from the length. In protocols with trailers (e.g., QUIC's
AEAD tag), event definition documents SHOULD define how to support header_length
calculation.

# Common events and data classes

There are some event types and data classes that are common across protocols,
applications, and use cases. This section specifies such common definitions.

## Generic events

In typical logging setups, users utilize a discrete number of well-defined logging
categories, levels or severities to log freeform (string) data. This generic
events category replicates this approach to allow implementations to fully replace
their existing text-based logging by qlog. This is done by providing events to log
generic strings for the typical well-known logging levels (error, warning, info,
debug, verbose).

For the events defined below, the "category" is "generic" and their "type" is the
name of the heading in lowercase (e.g., the "name" of the error event is
"generic:error").

### error

Used to log details of an internal error that might not get reflected on the
wire. It has Core importance level; see {{importance}}.

~~~ cddl
GenericError = {
    ? code: uint64
    ? message: text
}
~~~
{: #generic-error-def title="GenericError definition"}

### warning

Used to log details of an internal warning that might not get reflected on the
wire. It has Base importance level; see {{importance}}.

~~~ cddl
GenericWarning = {
    ? code: uint64
    ? message: text
}
~~~
{: #generic-warning-def title="GenericWarning definition"}

### info

Used mainly for implementations that want to use qlog as their one and only
logging format but still want to support unstructured string messages. The event
has Extra importance level; see {{importance}}.

~~~ cddl
GenericInfo = {
    message: text
}
~~~
{: #generic-info-def title="GenericInfo definition"}

### debug

Used mainly for implementations that want to use qlog as their one and only
logging format but still want to support unstructured string messages. The event
has Extra importance level; see {{importance}}.

~~~ cddl
GenericDebug = {
    message: text
}
~~~
{: #generic-debug-def title="GenericDebug definition"}

### verbose

Used mainly for implementations that want to use qlog as their one and only
logging format but still want to support unstructured string messages. The event
has Extra importance level; see {{importance}}.

~~~ cddl
GenericVerbose = {
    message: text
}
~~~
{: #generic-verbose-def title="GenericVerbose definition"}

## Simulation events

When evaluating a protocol implementation, one typically sets up a series of
interoperability or benchmarking tests, in which the test situations can change
over time. For example, the network bandwidth or latency can vary during the test,
or the network can be fully disable for a short time. In these setups, it is
useful to know when exactly these conditions are triggered, to allow for proper
correlation with other events.

For the events defined below, the "category" is "simulation" and their "type" is
the name of the heading in lowercase (e.g., the "name" of the scenario event is
"simulation:scenario").

### scenario

Used to specify which specific scenario is being tested at this particular
instance. This supports, for example, aggregation of several simulations into
one trace (e.g., split by `group_id`). It has Extra importance level; see
{{importance}}.

~~~ cddl
SimulationScenario = {
    ? name: text
    ? details: {* text => any }
}
~~~
{: #simulation-scenario-def title="SimulationScenario definition"}

### marker

Used to indicate when specific emulation conditions are triggered at set times
(e.g., at 3 seconds in 2% packet loss is introduced, at 10s a NAT rebind is
triggered). It has Extra importance level; see {{importance}}.

~~~ cddl
SimulationMarker = {
    ? type: text
    ? message: text
}
~~~
{: #simulation-marker-def title="SimulationMarker definition"}

# Event definition guidelines

This document defines the main schema for the qlog format together with some
common events, which on their own do not provide much logging utility. It is
expected that logging is extended with specific, per-protocol event definitions
that specify the name (category + type) and data needed for each individual
event. Examples include the QUIC event definitions {{QLOG-QUIC}} and HTTP/3 and
QPACK event definitions {{QLOG-H3}}.

This section defines some basic annotations and concepts that SHOULD be used by
event definition documents. Doing so ensures a measure of consistency that makes
it easier for qlog implementers to support a wide variety of protocols.

## Event design

There are several ways of defining qlog events. In practice, two main types of
approach have been observed: a) those that map directly to concepts seen in the
protocols (e.g., `packet_sent`) and b) those that act as aggregating events that
combine data from several possible protocol behaviors or code paths into one
(e.g., `parameters_set`). The latter are typically used as a means to reduce the
amount of unique event definitions, as reflecting each possible protocol event
as a separate qlog entity would cause an explosion of event types.

Additionally, logging duplicate data is typically prevented as much as possible.
For example, packet header values that remain consistent across many packets are
split into separate events (for example `spin_bit_updated` or
`connection_id_updated` for QUIC).

Finally, when logging additional state change events, those state changes can
often be directly inferred from data on the wire (for example flow control limit
changes). As such, if the implementation is bug-free and spec-compliant, logging
additional events is typically avoided. Exceptions have been made for common
events that benefit from being easily identifiable or individually logged (for
example `packets_acked`).

## Event importance levels {#importance}

Depending on how events are designed, it may be that several events allow the
logging of similar or overlapping data. For example the separate QUIC
`connection_started` event overlaps with the more generic
`connection_state_updated`. In these cases, it is not always clear which event
should be logged or used, and which event should take precedence if e.g., both are
present and provide conflicting information.

To aid in this decision making, qlog defines three event importance levels, in
decreasing order of importance and expected usage:

* Core
* Base
* Extra

Events definitions SHOULD assign an importance level.

Core-level events SHOULD be present in all qlog files for a
given protocol. These are typically tied to basic packet and frame parsing and
creation, as well as listing basic internal metrics. Tool implementers SHOULD
expect and add support for these events, though SHOULD NOT expect all Core events
to be present in each qlog trace.

Base-level events add additional debugging options and MAY be present in qlog
files. Most of these can be implicitly inferred from data in Core events (if
those contain all their properties), but for many it is better to log the events
explicitly as well, making it clearer how the implementation behaves. These
events are for example tied to passing data around in buffers, to how internal
state machines change, and used to help show when decisions are actually made
based on received data. Tool implementers SHOULD at least add support for
showing the contents of these events, if they do not handle them explicitly.

Extra-level events are considered mostly useful for low-level debugging of the
implementation, rather than the protocol. They allow more fine-grained tracking
of internal behavior. As such, they MAY be present in qlog files and tool
implementers MAY add support for these, but they are not required to.

Note that in some cases, implementers might not want to log for example data
content details in Core-level events due to performance or privacy considerations.
In this case, they SHOULD use (a subset of) relevant Base-level events instead to
ensure usability of the qlog output. As an example, implementations that do not
log QUIC `packet_received` events and thus also not which (if any) ACK frames the
packet contains, SHOULD log `packets_acked` events instead.

Finally, for event types whose data (partially) overlap with other event types'
definitions, where necessary the event definition document should include explicit
guidance on which to use in specific situations.

## Custom fields\

Event definition documents are free to define new category and event types,
top-level fields (e.g., a per-event field indicating its privacy properties or
path_id in multipath protocols), as well as values for the "trigger" property
within the "data" field, or other member fields of the "data" field, as they see
fit.

They however SHOULD NOT expect non-specialized tools to recognize or visualize
this custom data. However, tools SHOULD make an effort to visualize even unknown
data if possible in the specific tool's context. If they do not, they MUST ignore
these unknown fields.

# Serializing qlog {#concrete-formats}

qlog schema definitions in this document, {{QLOG-QUIC}} and {{QLOG-H3}} are
intentionally agnostic to serialization formats. The choice of format is an
implementation decision. Some examples of possible formats are JSON, CBOR, CSV,
protocol buffers, flatbuffers, etc.

Serialization formats make certain tradeoffs between usability, flexibility,
interoperability, and efficiency. Implementations should take these into
consideration when choosing a format. For instance, a textual format like JSON
can be more flexible than a binary format but more verbose, typically making it
less efficient than a binary format. A plaintext readable (yet relatively large)
format like JSON is potentially more usable for users operating on the logs
directly, while a more optimized yet restricted format can better suit the
constraints of a large scale operation. A custom or restricted format could be
more efficient for analysis with custom tooling but might not be interoperable
with general-purpose qlog tools.

Considering these tradeoffs, JSON-based serialization formats provide features
that make them a good starting point for qlog flexibility and interoperability.
For these reasons, JSON is a recommended default and expanded considerations are
given to how to map qlog to JSON ({{format-json}}, its subset
I-JSON {{format-ijson}}, and its streaming counterpart JSON Text Sequences ({{format-json-seq}}. Furthermore,
potential optimizations to these formats, such as reducing storage or processing
overheads, are presented in {{optimizations}}.

Serialization formats require appropriate deserializers/parsers. The
"qlog_format" field ({{qlog-file-schema}}) is used to indicate the chosen
serialization format.

## qlog to JSON mapping {#format-json}

As described in {{qlog-file-schema}}, JSON is the default qlog serialization. When
mapping qlog to normal JSON, QlogFile ({{qlog-file-def}}) is used and the
"qlog_format" field MUST have the value "JSON". The file extension/suffix SHOULD
be ".qlog". The Media Type, if any, SHOULD be "application/qlog+json" per
{{!RFC6839}}.

In accordance with {{Section 8.1 of !RFC8259}}, JSON files are required to use
UTF-8 both for the file itself and the string values it contains. In addition, all qlog
field names in a JSON serialization MUST be lowercase.

In order to serialize CDDL-based qlog event and data structure
definitions to JSON, the official CDDL-to-JSON mapping defined in
{{Appendix E of CDDL}} SHOULD be employed.

### I-JSON {#format-ijson}

Not all popular JSON parsers support the full JSON format, especially those
integrated within a JavaScript environment (e.g., Web browsers, NodeJS). For use
cases that involve these environments, it can be beneficial to use the JSON
subset dubbed I-JSON (or Internet-JSON); see {{!I-JSON=RFC7493}}.

One of the key limitations of JavaScript, and thus I-JSON, is that it cannot
represent full 64-bit integers in standard operating mode (i.e., without using
BigInt extensions), instead being limited to the range -(2<sup>53</sup>)+1 to
(2<sup>53</sup>)-1.

To accommodate such environments in CDDL, {{Appendix E of CDDL}} recommends
defining new CDDL types for int64 and uint64 that limit their values to the
restricted 64-bit integer range. This can be problematic, as some protocols
(e.g., QUIC, HTTP/3), might use the full int64/uint64 range and we therefore
need a qlog serialization format to support it. One solution to this is to allow
a string-based representation of 64-bit integers in addition to the numerical,
but range-limited representation.

As such, when using I-JSON in these situations, the following CDDL definition of
uint64 should override the original and parsers should take into account that a
uint64 field can either be a number or string.

~~~
uint64 = text /
         uint .size 8
~~~
{: #cddl-ijson-uint64-def title="Custom uint64 definition for I-JSON"}

## qlog to JSON Text Sequences mapping {#format-json-seq}

One of the downsides of using normal JSON is that it is inherently a
non-streamable format. A qlog serializer could work around this by opening a
file, writing the required opening data, streaming qlog events by appending
them, and then finalizing the log by appending appropriate closing tags e.g.,
"]}]}". However, failure to append closing tags, could lead to problems because
most JSON parsers will fail if a document is malformed. Some streaming JSON
parsers are able to handle missing closing tags, however they are not widely
deployed in popular environments (e.g., Web browsers)

To overcome the issues related to JSON streaming, a qlog mapping to a streamable
JSON format called JSON Text Sequences (JSON-SEQ) ({{!RFC7464}}) is provided.

JSON Text Sequences are very similar to JSON, except that objects are
serialized as individual records, each prefixed by an ASCII Record Separator
(\<RS\>, 0x1E), and each ending with an ASCII Line Feed character (\n, 0x0A). Note
that each record can also contain any amount of newlines in its body, as long as
it ends with a newline character before the next \<RS\> character.

In order to leverage the streaming capability, each qlog event is serialized and
interpreted as an individual JSON Text Sequence record, that is appended as a
new object to the back of an event stream or log file. Put differently, unlike
default JSON, it does not require a document to be wrapped as a full object with
"{ ... }" or "\[... \]".

This alternative record streaming approach cannot be accommodated by QlogFile
({{qlog-file-def}}). Instead, QlogFileSeq is defined in {{qlog-file-seq-def}},
which notably includes only a single trace (TraceSeq) and omits an explicit
"events" array. An example is provided in {{json-seq-ex}}. The "group_id" field
can still be used on a per-event basis to include events from conceptually
different sources in a single JSON-SEQ qlog file.

When mapping qlog to JSON-SEQ, the "qlog_format" field MUST have the value
"JSON-SEQ". The file extension/suffix SHOULD be ".sqlog" (for "streaming" qlog).
The Media Type, if any, SHOULD be "application/qlog+json-seq" per {{!RFC8091}}.

While not specifically required by the JSON-SEQ specification, all qlog
field names in a JSON-SEQ serialization MUST be lowercase.

In order to serialize all other CDDL-based qlog event and data structure
definitions to JSON-SEQ, the official CDDL-to-JSON mapping defined in
{{Appendix E of CDDL}} SHOULD be employed.


### Supporting JSON Text Sequences in tooling

Note that JSON Text Sequences are not supported in most default programming
environments (unlike normal JSON). However, several custom JSON-SEQ parsing
libraries exist in most programming languages that can be used and the format is
easy enough to parse with existing implementations (i.e., by splitting the file
into its component records and feeding them to a normal JSON parser individually,
as each record by itself is a valid JSON object).

## Truncated values {#truncated-values}

For some use cases (e.g., limiting file size, privacy), it can be
necessary not to log a full raw blob (using the `hexstring` type) but
instead a truncated value. For example, one might only store the first 100 bytes of an
HTTP response body to be able to discern which file it actually
contained. In these cases, the original byte-size length cannot be
obtained from the serialized value directly.

As such, all qlog schema definitions SHOULD include a separate,
length-indicating field for all fields of type `hexstring` they specify,
see for example {{raw-info}}. This not only ensures the original length
can always be retrieved, but also allows the omission of any raw value
bytes of the field completely (e.g., out of privacy or security
considerations).

To reduce overhead however and in the case the full raw value is logged,
the extra length-indicating field can be left out. As such, tools MUST
be able to deal with this situation and derive the length of the field
from the raw value if no separate length-indicating field is present.
The main possible permutations are shown by example in
{{truncated-values-ex}}.

~~~~~~~~
// both the content's value and its length are present
// (length is redundant)
{
    "content_length": 5,
    "content": "051428abff"
}

// only the content value is present, indicating it
// represents the content's full value. The byte
// length is obtained by calculating content.length / 2
{
    "content": "051428abff"
}

// only the length is present, meaning the value
// was omitted
{
    "content_length": 5,
}

// both value and length are present, but the lengths
// do not match: the value was truncated to
// the first three bytes.
{
    "content_length": 5,
    "content": "051428"
}
~~~~~~~~
{: #truncated-values-ex title="Example for serializing truncated
hexstrings"}

## Optimization of serialized data {#optimizations}

Both the JSON and JSON-SEQ formatting options described above are serviceable in
general small to medium scale (debugging) setups. However, these approaches tend
to be relatively verbose, leading to larger file sizes. Additionally, generalized
JSON(-SEQ) (de)serialization performance is typically (slightly) lower than that
of more optimized and predictable formats. Both aspects present challenges to
large scale setups, though they may still be practical to deploy; see [ANRW-2020].
JSON and JSON-SEQ compress very well using commonly-available algorithms such as
GZIP or Brotli.

During the development of qlog, a multitude of alternative formatting
and optimization options were assessed and the results are [summarized on the qlog
github
repository](https://github.com/quiclog/internet-drafts/issues/30#issuecomment-617675097).

Formal definition of additional qlog formats or encodings that use the
optimization techniques described here, or any other optimization technique is
left to future activity that can apply the following guidelines.

In order to help tools correctly parse and process serialized qlog, it is
RECOMMENDED that new formats also define suitable file extensions and media
types. This provides a clear signal and avoids the need to provide out-of-band
information or to rely on heuristic fallbacks; see {{tooling}}.

# Methods of access and generation

Different implementations will have different ways of generating and storing
qlogs. However, there is still value in defining a few default ways in which to
steer this generation and access of the results.

## Set file output destination via an environment variable

To provide users control over where and how qlog files are created, two
environment variables are defined. The first, QLOGFILE, indicates a full path to where an
individual qlog file should be stored. This path MUST include the full file
extension. The second, QLOGDIR, sets a general directory path in which qlog files
should be placed. This path MUST include the directory separator character at the
end.

In general, QLOGDIR should be preferred over QLOGFILE if an endpoint is prone to
generate multiple qlog files. This can for example be the case for a QUIC server
implementation that logs each QUIC connection in a separate qlog file. An
alternative that uses QLOGFILE would be a QUIC server that logs all connections in
a single file and uses the "group_id" field ({{group-ids}}) to allow post-hoc
separation of events.

Implementations SHOULD provide support for QLOGDIR and MAY provide support for
QLOGFILE.

When using QLOGDIR, it is up to the implementation to choose an appropriate naming
scheme for the qlog files themselves. The chosen scheme will typically depend on
the context or protocols used. For example, for QUIC, it is recommended to use the
Original Destination Connection ID (ODCID), followed by the vantage point type of
the logging endpoint. Examples of all options for QUIC are shown in
{{qlogdir-example}}.

~~~~~~~~
Command: QLOGFILE=/srv/qlogs/client.qlog quicclientbinary

Should result in the the quicclientbinary executable logging a
single qlog file named client.qlog in the /srv/qlogs directory.
This is for example useful in tests when the client sets up
just a single connection and then exits.

Command: QLOGDIR=/srv/qlogs/ quicserverbinary

Should result in the quicserverbinary executable generating
several logs files, one for each QUIC connection.
Given two QUIC connections, with ODCID values "abcde" and
"12345" respectively, this would result in two files:
/srv/qlogs/abcde_server.qlog
/srv/qlogs/12345_server.qlog

Command: QLOGFILE=/srv/qlogs/server.qlog quicserverbinary

Should result in the the quicserverbinary executable logging
a single qlog file named server.qlog in the /srv/qlogs directory.
Given that the server handled two QUIC connections before it was
shut down, with ODCID values "abcde" and "12345" respectively,
this would result in event instances in the qlog file being
tagged with the "group_id" field with values "abcde" and "12345".

# Tooling requirements {#tooling}

Tools ingestion qlog MUST indicate which qlog version(s), qlog format(s),
compression methods and potentially other input file formats (for example .pcap)
they support. Tools SHOULD at least support .qlog files in the default JSON format
({{format-json}}). Additionally, they SHOULD indicate exactly which values for and
properties of the name (category and type) and data fields they look for to
execute their logic. Tools SHOULD perform a (high-level) check if an input qlog
file adheres to the expected qlog schema. If a tool determines a qlog file does
not contain enough supported information to correctly execute the tool's logic, it
SHOULD generate a clear error message to this effect.

Tools MUST NOT produce breaking errors for any field names and/or values in the
qlog format that they do not recognize. Tools SHOULD indicate even unknown event
occurrences within their context (e.g., marking unknown events on a timeline for
manual interpretation by the user).

Tool authors should be aware that, depending on the logging implementation, some
events will not always be present in all traces. For example, using a circular
logging buffer of a fixed size, it could be that the earliest events (e.g.,
connection setup events) are later overwritten by "newer" events. Alternatively,
some events can be intentionally omitted out of privacy or file size
considerations. Tool authors are encouraged to make their tools robust enough to
still provide adequate output for incomplete logs.

# Security and privacy considerations {#privacy}

Protocols such as TLS {{?RFC8446}} and QUIC {{?RFC9000}} provide varying degrees
of secure protection for the wire image {{?RFC8546}}. There is inevitably
tension between security and observability, when logging can reveal aspects of
the wire image that would ordinarily be protected. This tension equally applies
to any privacy considerations that build on security properties, especially if
data can be correlated across data sources.

Any data that is determined to be necessary for a use case at hand could be
logged or captured. As per {{?RFC6973}}, operators must be aware that such data
will be at risk of compromise and this, in turn, risks the privacy of all
entities that participate in logged internet protocol exchanges. Entities that
would otherwise expect protocol features to maintain the privacy of their data,
can unknowingly be subject to broader privacy risks. This circumvents their
agency for responding to such risks.

## Data at risk

qlog operators and implementers should be mindful of the security and privacy
risks inherent in handling qlog data. This includes but is not limited to
logging, storing, or using the data. Data might be considered as non-sensitive,
potentially-sensitive, or sensitive; applying the considerations in this section
may produce different risks depending on the nature of the data itself, or its
handling. However, in many cases the largest risk factors arise from data that
can be considered as potenially-sensitive or sensitive.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of such fields and types of data that can
be carried in qlog data:

* IP addresses and transport protocol port numbers, which can be used to
  uniquely identify individual connections, endpoints, and potentially users.

* Session, Connection, or User identifiers which can be used to correlate
  nominally separate contexts. For example, QUIC Connection IDs can be used to
  identify and track users across geographical networks {{Section 9.5 of
  !RFC9000}}).

* System-level information such as CPU, process, or thread identifiers.

* Stored State which can be used to correlate individual connections or sessions
  over time. Examples include QUIC address validation and retry tokens, TLS
  session tickets, and HTTP cookies.

* Decryption keys, passwords, and tokens which can be used with other data
  sources (e.g., captures of encrypted packets) to correlate qlog data to a
  specific connection or user or leak additional information. Examples include
  TLS decryption keys and HTTP-level API access or authorization tokens.

* Data that can be used to correlate qlogs to other data sources (e.g., captures
  of encrypted packets). Examples include high-resolution event timestamps or
  inter-event timings, event counts, packet and frame sizes.

* Full or partial encrypted raw packet and frame payloads, which can be used
  with other data sources (e.g., captures of encrypted packets) to correlate
  qlog data to a specific connection or session.

* Full or partial plaintext raw packet and frame payloads (e.g., HTTP Field
  values, HTTP response data, TLS SNI field values), which can contain directly
  sensitive information.

## Operational implications and recommendations

Considerations for operational implications should focus on log capture and
access. Logging of Internet protocols is equivalent to access to store or read
plaintext communications, so security considerations apply similarly to qlog.

It is recommended that the ability to enable qlog capture is subject to access
control and auditing. Furthermore, access control policy should extend to the
level of information that is allowed to be captured (e.g., capture of
more-sensitive data requires higher privileges).

It is recommended that access to stored qlogs is subject to access control and
auditing.

Access control techniques in end user client environments can be limited. An
end-user that might enable logging without understanding the implications of
that choice on their privacy and security. Implementations should consider how
to make enabling qlog conspicous, and resistant to social engineering,
automation, or drive-by attacks. Examples include, requiring explicit actions to
start a capture, and isolation or sandboxing of capture from other activities in
the same process or component.

It is recommended that data retention policies are defined for the storage of
qlog files.

It is recommended that qlog files are encrypted in transit and at rest.

## Data minimization or anonymization

Data minimization or anonymization techniques can be applied to qlog. While this
can go some way to addressing security and privacy risks, implementers and
operators are advised that removing or anonymizing data without sufficient care might
not improve privacy or securrity.
Minimization or anonymization might greatly reduce the usefulness
of qlog data.

Operator and implementers need to balance the value of logged data against the potential
risks inherent in their (involuntary) disclosure. This balance depends on the
use case at hand (e.g., research datasets might have different requirements to
live operational troubleshooting).

The simplest and most extreme form of minimization or anonymization is the
complete deletion of a given field, which is equivalent to not logging the
field(s) in question. qlog implementations that provide fine-grained control
over the inclusion of data fields, ideally on a per-use-case or per-connection
basis, improve the ability to minimize data.

Data can be anonymized, pseudonymized, otherwise permutated/replaced, truncated,
(re-)encrypted, or aggregated. A partial discussion of applicable techniques
(especially for IP address information) can be found in {{Appendix B of
!DNS-PRIVACY=RFC8932}}. Operators should, however, be aware that many of these
techniques have been shown to be insufficient to safeguard user privacy and/or
to protect user identity, especially if a qlog data set is large or easily
correlated against other data sources.

Finally, qlog operators should consider the interplay between their use case
needs and end user rights or preferences. While active user participation (as
indicated by {{!RFC6973}}) on a per-qlog basis is difficult, as logs are often
captured out-of-band to the main user interaction and intent, general user
expectations should be taken into account. qlog deployments should consider how
to align capture, storage and removal of qlogs with more general, often
pre-existing, user preference and privacy control systems. Operators should
consider agressive approaches to deletion or aggregation.

In qlog, data that is likely to be most sensitive is typically (but not
exclusively) contained in fields of the RawInfo type (see {{raw-info}}). qlog
users should thus be particularly hesitant to include these fields for all but
the most stringent use cases.
