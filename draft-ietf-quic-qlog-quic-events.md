# Introduction

This document defines a qlog event schema ({{Section 8 of QLOG-MAIN}})
containing concrete events for the core QUIC protocol (see
{{!QUIC-TRANSPORT=RFC9000}}, {{!QUIC-RECOVERY=RFC9002}}, and
{{!QUIC-TLS=RFC9001}}) and some of its extensions (see
{{!QUIC-DATAGRAM=RFC9221}} and {{!GREASEBIT=RFC9287}}).

The event schema namespace `quic` is defined, containing the categories:
`connectivity` ({{conn-ev}}), `security` ({{sec-ev}}), `quic` {{quic-ev}}, and
`recovery` {{rec-ev}}. Across these categories multiple events derive from the
qlog abstract Event class ({{Section 7 of QLOG-MAIN}}), each extending the
"data" field and defining their "name" field values and semantics. Some data
fields use complex datastructures. These are represented as enums or re-usable
definitions, which are grouped together on the bottom of this document for
clarity.

When any event from this document is included in a qlog trace, the
`protocol_types` qlog array field MUST contain an entry with the value "QUIC":

~~~ cddl
$ProtocolType /= "QUIC"
~~~
{: #protocoltype-extension-quic title="ProtocolType extension for QUIC"}

## Use of group IDs

When the qlog `group_id` field is used, it is recommended to use QUIC's Original
Destination Connection ID (ODCID, the CID chosen by the client when first
contacting the server), as this is the only value that does not change over the
course of the connection and can be used to link more advanced QUIC packets (e.g.,
Retry, Version Negotiation) to a given connection. Similarly, the ODCID should be
used as the qlog filename or file identifier, potentially suffixed by the
vantagepoint type (For example, abcd1234_server.qlog would contain the server-side
trace of the connection with ODCID abcd1234).

## Raw packet and frame information

QUIC packets always include an AEAD authentication tag at the end. In general,
the length of the AEAD tag depends on the TLS cipher suite, although all cipher
suites used in QUIC v1 use a 16 byte tag. For the purposes of calculating the
lengths in fields of type RawInfo (as defined in {{QLOG-MAIN}}) related to QUIC
packets, the AEAD tag is regarded as a trailer.

## Events not belonging to a single connection {#handling-unknown-connections}

A single qlog event trace is typically associated with a single QUIC connection.
However, for several types of events (for example, a {{quic-packetdropped}}
event with trigger value of `connection_unknown`), it can be impossible to tie
them to a specific QUIC connection, especially on the server.

There are various ways to handle these events, each making certain tradeoffs
between file size overhead, flexibility, ease of use, or ease of
implementation. Some options include:

* Log them in a separate endpoint-wide trace (or use a special `group_id` value)
  not associated with a single connection.
* Log them in the most recently used trace.
* Use additional heuristics for connection identification (for example use the
  four-tuple in addition to the Connection ID).
* Buffer events until they can be assigned to a connection (for example for
  version negotiation and retry events).

## Notational Conventions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

The event and data structure definitions in ths document are expressed
in the Concise Data Definition Language {{!CDDL=RFC8610}} and its
extensions described in {{QLOG-MAIN}}.

The following fields from {{QLOG-MAIN}} are imported and used: name, category,
type, data, group_id, protocol_types, importance, RawInfo, and time-related
fields.

As is the case for {{QLOG-MAIN}}, the qlog schema definitions in this document
are intentionally agnostic to serialization formats. The choice of format is an
implementation decision.

# Event Schema Definition {#schema-def}

This document describes how the core QUIC protocol and selected extensions can
be expressed in qlog using a newly defined event schema. Per the requirements in
{{Section 8 of QLOG-MAIN}}, this document registers the `quic` namespace and the
following category identifiers and URIs.

* `connectivity` - `urn:ietf:params:qlog:events:quic#connectivity`
* `security` - `urn:ietf:params:qlog:events:quic#security`
* `quic` - `urn:ietf:params:qlog:events:quic#quic`
* `recovery` - `urn:ietf:params:qlog:events:quic#recovery`

## Draft Event Schema Identification
{:removeinrfc="true"}

Only implementations of the final, published RFC can use the events belonging to
the category with the URIs `urn:ietf:params:qlog:events:quic#connectivity`,
`urn:ietf:params:qlog:events:quic#security`,
`urn:ietf:params:qlog:events:quic#quic`, and
`urn:ietf:params:qlog:events:quic#recovery`. Until such an RFC exists,
implementations MUST NOT identify themselves using this URI.

Implementations of draft versions of the event schema MUST append the string
"-" and the corresponding draft number to the URI. For example, draft 07 of this
document is identified using the URI `urn:ietf:params:qlog:events:quic#quic-07`.

The category identifier itself is not affected by this requirement.

QUIC events extend the `$ProtocolEventData` extension point defined in
{{QLOG-MAIN}}. Additionally, they allow for direct extensibility by their use of
per-event extension points via the `$$` CDDL "group socket" syntax, as also
described in {{QLOG-MAIN}}.

# Connectivity events {#conn-ev}

## server_listening {#connectivity-serverlistening}

Emitted when the server starts accepting connections. It has Extra importance
level; see {{Section 9.2 of QLOG-MAIN}}.

~~~ cddl
ConnectivityServerListening = {
    ? ip_v4: IPAddress
    ? ip_v6: IPAddress
    ? port_v4: uint16
    ? port_v6: uint16

    ; the server will always answer client initials with a retry
    ; (no 1-RTT connection setups by choice)
    ? retry_required: bool

    * $$connectivity-serverlistening-extension
}
~~~
{: #connectivity-serverlistening-def title="ConnectivityServerListening definition"}

Some QUIC stacks do not handle sockets directly and are thus unable to log
IP and/or port information.

## connection_started {#connectivity-connectionstarted}

The `connection_started` event is used for both attempting (client-perspective)
and accepting (server-perspective) new connections. Note that while there is
overlap with the `connection_state_updated` event, this event is separate event
in order to capture additional data that can be useful to log. It has Base
importance level; see {{Section 9.2 of QLOG-MAIN}}.

~~~ cddl
ConnectivityConnectionStarted = {
    ? ip_version: IPVersion
    src_ip: IPAddress
    dst_ip: IPAddress

    ; transport layer protocol
    ? protocol: text .default "QUIC"
    ? src_port: uint16
    ? dst_port: uint16
    ? src_cid: ConnectionID
    ? dst_cid: ConnectionID

    * $$connectivity-connectionstarted-extension
}
~~~
{: #connectivity-connectionstarted-def title="ConnectivityConnectionStarted definition"}

Some QUIC stacks do not handle sockets directly and are thus unable to log
IP and/or port information.

## connection_closed {#connectivity-connectionclosed}

The `connection_closed` event is used for logging when a connection was closed,
typically when an error or timeout occurred. It has Base importance level; see
{{Section 9.2 of QLOG-MAIN}}.

Note that this event has overlap with the `connection_state_updated` event, as
well as the CONNECTION_CLOSE frame. However, in practice, when analyzing large
deployments, it can be useful to have a single event representing a
`connection_closed` event, which also includes an additional reason field to
provide more information. Furthermore, it is useful to log closures due to
timeouts, which are difficult to reflect using the other options.

The `connection_closed` event is intended to be logged either when the local
endpoint silently discards the connection due to an idle timeout, when a
CONNECTION_CLOSE frame is sent (the connection enters the 'closing' state on the
sender side), when a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame is received (the connection enters
the 'draining' state on the receiver side) or when a Stateless Reset packet is
received (the connection is discarded at the receiver side).
Connectivity-related updates after this point (e.g., exiting a 'closing' or
'draining' state), should be logged using the `connection_state_updated` event
instead.

In QUIC there are two main connection-closing error categories: connection and
application errors. They have well-defined error codes and semantics. Next to
these however, there can be internal errors that occur that may or may not get
mapped to the official error codes in implementation-specific ways. As such,
multiple error codes can be set on the same event to reflect this.

~~~ cddl
ConnectivityConnectionClosed = {

    ; which side closed the connection
    ? owner: Owner
    ? connection_code: $TransportError /
                       CryptoError /
                       uint32
    ? application_code: $ApplicationError /
                        uint32
    ? internal_code: uint32
    ? reason: text
    ? trigger:
        "idle_timeout" /
        "application" /
        "error" /
        "version_mismatch" /
        ; when received from peer
        "stateless_reset" /
        ; when it is unclear what triggered the CONNECTION_CLOSE
        "unspecified"

    * $$connectivity-connectionclosed-extension
}
~~~
{: #connectivity-connectionclosed-def title="ConnectivityConnectionClosed definition"}

Loggers SHOULD use the most descriptive trigger for a `connection_closed` event
that they are able to deduce. This is often clear at the peer closing the
connection (and sending the CONNECTION_CLOSE), but can sometimes be more opaque
at the receiving end.


## connection_id_updated {#connectivity-connectionidupdated}

The `connection_id_updated` event is emitted when either party updates their
current Connection ID. As this typically happens only sparingly over the course
of a connection, using this event is more efficient than logging the observed
CID with each and every `packet_sent` or `packet_received` events. It has Base
importance level; see {{Section 9.2 of QLOG-MAIN}}.

The `connection_id_updated` event is viewed from the perspective of the endpoint
applying the new ID. As such, when the endpoint receives a new connection ID
from the peer, the owner field will be "remote". When the endpoint updates its
own connection ID, the owner field will be "local".

~~~ cddl
ConnectivityConnectionIDUpdated = {
    owner: Owner
    ? old: ConnectionID
    ? new: ConnectionID

    * $$connectivity-connectionidupdated-extension
}
~~~
{: #connectivity-connectionidupdated-def title="ConnectivityConnectionIDUpdated definition"}

## spin_bit_updated {#connectivity-spinbitupdated}

The `spin_bit_updated` event conveys information about the QUIC latency spin
bit; see {{Section 17.4 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}. The event is emitted when the spin
bit changes value, it SHOULD NOT be emitted if the spin bit is set without
changing its value. It has Base importance level; see {{Section 9.2 of
QLOG-MAIN}}.

~~~ cddl
ConnectivitySpinBitUpdated = {
    state: bool

    * $$connectivity-spinbitupdated-extension
}
~~~
{: #connectivity-spinbitupdated-def title="ConnectivitySpinBitUpdated definition"}

## connection_state_updated {#connectivity-connectionstateupdated}

The `connection_state_updated` event is used to track progress through QUIC's
complex handshake and connection close procedures. It has Base importance
level; see {{Section 9.2 of QLOG-MAIN}}.

{{!QUIC-TRANSPORT}} does not contain an exhaustive flow diagram with possible
connection states nor their transitions (though some are explicitly mentioned,
like the 'closing' and 'draining' states). As such, this document
**non-exhaustively** defines those states that are most likely to be useful for
debugging QUIC connections.

QUIC implementations SHOULD mainly log the simplified BaseConnectionStates,
adding the more fine-grained GranularConnectionStates when more in-depth
debugging is required. Tools SHOULD be able to deal with both types equally.

~~~ cddl
ConnectivityConnectionStateUpdated = {
    ? old: $ConnectionState
    new: $ConnectionState

    * $$connectivity-connectionstateupdated-extension
}

BaseConnectionStates =
    ; Initial packet sent/received
    "attempted" /

    ; Handshake packet sent/received
    "handshake_started" /

    ; Both sent a TLS Finished message and verified the peer's TLS Finished message
    ; 1-RTT packets can be sent
    ; RFC 9001 Section 4.1.1
    "handshake_complete" /

    ; CONNECTION_CLOSE sent/received, stateless reset received or idle timeout
    "closed"

GranularConnectionStates =
    ; RFC 9000 Section 8.1
    ; client sent Handshake packet OR
    ; client used connection ID chosen by the server OR
    ; client used valid address validation token
    "peer_validated" /

    ; 1-RTT data can be sent by the server, but handshake is not done yet
    ; (server has sent TLS Finished; sometimes called 0.5 RTT data)
    "early_write" /

    ; HANDSHAKE_DONE sent/received.
    ; RFC 9001 Section 4.1.2
    "handshake_confirmed" /

    ; CONNECTION_CLOSE sent
    "closing" /

    ; CONNECTION_CLOSE received
    "draining" /

    ; draining or closing period done, connection state discarded
    "closed"

$ConnectionState /= BaseConnectionStates / GranularConnectionStates
~~~
{: #connectivity-connectionstateupdated-def title="ConnectivityConnectionStateUpdated definition"}

The `connection_state_changed` event has some overlap with the
`connection_closed` and `connection_started` events, and the handling of various
frames (for example in a `packet_received` event). Still, it can be useful to
log these logical state transitions separately, especially if they map to an
internal implementation state machine, to explicitly track progress. As such,
implementations are allowed to use other ConnectionState values that adhere more
closely to their internal logic. Tools SHOULD be able to deal with these custom
states in a similar way to the pre-defined states in this document.

## path_assigned {#connectivity-pathassigned}
Importance: Base

This event is used to associate a single PathID's value with other parameters
that describe a unique network path.

As described in {{QLOG-MAIN}}, each qlog event can be linked to a single network
path by means of the top-level "path" field, whose value is a PathID. However,
since it can be cumbersome to encode additional path metadata (such as IP
addresses or Connection IDs) directly into the PathID, this event allows such an
association to happen separately. As such, PathIDs can be short and unique, and
can even be updated to be associated with new metadata as the connection's state
evolves.

Definition:

~~~ cddl
ConnectivityPathAssigned = {
    path_id: PathID

    ; the information for traffic going towards the remote receiver
    ? path_remote: PathEndpointInfo

    ; the information for traffic coming in at the local endpoint
    ? path_local: PathEndpointInfo

    * $$connectivity-pathassigned-extension
}
~~~
{: #connectivity-pathassigned-def title="ConnectivityPathAssigned definition"}

Choosing the different `path_id` values is left up to the implementation. Some
options include using a uniquely incrementing integer, using the (first)
Destination Connection ID associated with a path (or its sequence number), or
using (a hash of) the two endpoint IP addresses.

It is important to note that the empty string ("") is a valid PathID and that it
is the default assigned to events that do not explicitly set a "path" field. Put
differently, the initial path of a QUIC connection on which the handshake occurs
(see also {{connectivity-connectionstarted}}) is implicitly associated with the
PathID with value "". Associating metadata with this default path is possible by
logging the ConnectivityPathAssigned event with a value of "" for the `path_id`
field.

As paths and their metadata can evolve over time, multiple
ConnectivityPathAssigned events can be emitted for each unique PathID. The
latest event contains the most up-to-date information for that PathID. As such,
the first time a PathID is seen in a ConnectivityPathAssigned event, it is an
indication that the path is created. Subsequent occurrences indicate the path is
updated, while a final occurrence with both `path_local` and `path_remote`
fields omitted implicitly indicates the path has been abandoned.

## mtu_updated {#connectivity-mtuupdated}

The `mtu_updated` event indicates that the estimated Path MTU was updated. This
happens as part of the Path MTU discovery process. It has Extra importance
level; see {{Section 9.2 of QLOG-MAIN}}.

~~~ cddl
ConnectivityMTUUpdated = {
    ? old: uint32
    new: uint32

    ; at some point, MTU discovery stops, as a "good enough"
    ; packet size has been found
    ? done: bool .default false

    * $$connectivity-mtuupdated-extension
}
~~~
{: #connectivity-mtuupdated-def title="ConnectivityMTUUpdated definition"}

# QUIC events  {#quic-ev}

## version_information {#quic-versioninformation}

The `version_information` event supports QUIC version negotiation; see {{Section
6 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}. It has Core importance level; see {{Section 9.2 of
QLOG-MAIN}}.

QUIC endpoints each have their own list of QUIC versions they support. The
client uses the most likely version in their first initial. If the server does
not support that version, it replies with a Version Negotiation packet, which
contains its supported versions. From this, the client selects a version. The
`version_information` event aggregates all this information in a single event
type. It also allows logging of supported versions at an endpoint without actual
version negotiation needing to happen.

~~~ cddl
QUICVersionInformation = {
    ? server_versions: [+ QuicVersion]
    ? client_versions: [+ QuicVersion]
    ? chosen_version: QuicVersion

    * $$quic-versioninformation-extension
}
~~~
{: #quic-versioninformation-def title="QUICVersionInformation definition"}

Intended use:

- When sending an initial, the client logs this event with `client_versions` and
  `chosen_version` set
- Upon receiving a client initial with a supported version, the server logs this
  event with `server_versions` and `chosen_version` set
- Upon receiving a client initial with an unsupported version, the server logs
  this event with `server_versions` set and `client_versions` to the
  single-element array containing the client's attempted version. The absence of
  chosen_version implies no overlap was found
- Upon receiving a version negotiation packet from the server, the client logs
  this event with `client_versions` set and `server_versions` to the versions in
  the version negotiation packet and chosen_version to the version it will use
  for the next initial packet. If the client receives a set of `server_versions`
  with no viable overlap with its own supported versions, this event should be
  logged without the `chosen_version` set

## alpn_information {#quic-alpninformation}

The `alpn_information` event supports Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation
(ALPN) over the QUIC transport; see {{?RFC7301}} and {{Section 7.4 of
QUIC-TRANSPORT}}. It has Core importance level; see {{Section 9.2 of
QLOG-MAIN}}.

QUIC endpoints are configured with a list of supported ALPN identifiers. Clients send the list in a TLS ClientHello, and servers match against their list. On success, a single ALPN identifier is chosen and sent back in a TLS ServerHello. If no match is found, the connection is closed.

ALPN identifiers are byte sequences, that may be possible to present as UTF-8.
The `ALPNIdentifier`` type supports either format. Implementations SHOULD log at
least one format, but MAY log both or none.

~~~ cddl
QUICALPNInformation = {
    ? server_alpns: [* ALPNIdentifier]
    ? client_alpns: [* ALPNIdentifier]
    ? chosen_alpn: ALPNIdentifier

    * $$quic-alpninformation-extension
}

ALPNIdentifier = {
  ? byte_value: hexstring
  ? string_value: text
}
~~~
{: #quic-alpninformation-def title="QUICALPNInformation definition"}

Intended use:

- When sending an initial, the client logs this event with `client_alpns` set
- When receiving an initial with a supported alpn, the server logs this event
  with `server_alpns` set, `client_alpns` equalling the client-provided list,
  and chosen_alpn to the value it will send back to the client.
- When receiving an initial with an alpn, the client logs this event with
  `chosen_alpn` to the received value.
- Alternatively, a client can choose to not log the first event, but wait for
  the receipt of the server initial to log this event with both `client_alpns`
  and `chosen_alpn` set.

## parameters_set {#quic-parametersset}

The `parameters_set` event groups settings from several different sources
(transport parameters, TLS ciphers, etc.) into a single event. This is done to
minimize the amount of events and to decouple conceptual setting impacts from
their underlying mechanism for easier high-level reasoning. The event has Core
importance level; see {{Section 9.2 of QLOG-MAIN}}.

Most of these settings are typically set once and never change. However, they
are usually set at different times during the connection, so there will
regularly be several instances of this event with different fields set.

Note that some settings have two variations (one set locally, one requested by the
remote peer). This is reflected in the `owner` field. As such, this field MUST be
correct for all settings included a single event instance. If you need to log
settings from two sides, you MUST emit two separate event instances.

In the case of connection resumption and 0-RTT, some of the server's parameters
are stored up-front at the client and used for the initial connection startup.
They are later updated with the server's reply. In these cases, utilize the
separate `parameters_restored` event to indicate the initial values, and this
event to indicate the updated values, as normal.

When using QUIC 0-RTT, clients are expected to remember and restore the server's
transport parameters from the previous connection. The `parameters_restored`
event is used to indicate which parameters were restored and to which values
when utilizing 0-RTT. It has Base importance level; see {{Section 9.2 of

## packet_dropped {#quic-packetdropped}

The `packet_dropped` event indicates a QUIC-level packet was dropped. It has
Base importance level; see {{Section 9.2 of QLOG-MAIN}}.

The trigger field indicates a general reason category for dropping the packet,
while the details field can contain additional implementation-specific
information.

~~~ cddl
QUICPacketDropped = {

    ; Primarily packet_type should be filled here,
    ; as other fields might not be decrypteable or parseable
    ? header: PacketHeader

}
~~~
{: #quic-packetdropped-def title="QUICPacketDropped definition"}

Some example situations for each of the trigger categories include:

- `internal_error`: not initialized, out of memory
- `rejected`: limits reached, DDoS protection, unwilling to track more paths, duplicate packet
- `unsupported`: unknown or unsupported version. See also {{handling-unknown-connections}}.
- `invalid`: packet parsing or validation error
- `duplicate`: duplicate packet
- `connection_unknown`: packet does not relate to a known connection or Connection ID
- `decryption_failure`: decryption failed
- `key_unavailable`: decryption key was unavailable
- `general`: situations not clearly covered in the other categories

The `datagram_id` field is used to track packet coalescing, see
{{quic-udpdatagramssent}}.

## packet_buffered {#quic-packetbuffered}

The `packet_buffered` event is emitted when a packet is buffered because it
cannot be processed yet. Typically, this is because the packet cannot be parsed
yet, and thus only the full packet contents can be logged when it was parsed in
a `packet_received` event. The event has Base importance level; see {{Section
9.2 of QLOG-MAIN}}.

~~~ cddl

    ; primarily packet_type and possible packet_number should be

The `datagram_id` field is used to track packet coalescing, see
{{quic-udpdatagramssent}}.

## packets_acked {#quic-packetsacked}

The `packets_acked` event is emitted when a (group of) sent packet(s) is
acknowledged by the remote peer _for the first time_. It has Extra importance
level; see {{Section 9.2 of QLOG-MAIN}}.

This information could also be deduced from the contents of received ACK frames.
However, ACK frames require additional processing logic to determine when a
given packet is acknowledged for the first time, as QUIC uses ACK ranges which
can include repeated ACKs. Additionally, this event can be used by
implementations that do not log frame contents.

~~~ cddl
QUICPacketsAcked = {
    ? packet_number_space: $PacketNumberSpace
    ? packet_numbers: [+ uint64]

    * $$quic-packetsacked-extension
}
~~~

If `packet_number_space` is omitted, it assumes the default value of
`application_data`, as this is by far the most prevalent packet
number space a typical QUIC connection will use.

## udp_datagrams_sent {#quic-udpdatagramssent}

The `datagrams_sent` event indicates when one or more UDP-level datagrams are
passed to the underlying network socket. This is useful for determining how QUIC
packet buffers are drained to the OS. The event has Extra importance level; see
{{Section 9.2 of QLOG-MAIN}}.

~~~ cddl
QUICUDPDatagramsSent = {

    ; to support passing multiple at once
    ? count: uint16

    ; The RawInfo fields do not include the UDP headers,
    ; only the UDP payload

    ; ECN bits in the IP header
    ; if not set, defaults to the value used on the last
    ; QUICDatagramsSent event

    ? datagram_ids: [+ uint32]

    * $$quic-udpdatagramssent-extension
}
~~~
{: #quic-udpdatagramssent-def title="QUICUDPDatagramsSent definition"}

Since QUIC implementations rarely control UDP logic directly, the raw data
excludes UDP-level headers in all RawInfo fields.

Multiple QUIC packets can be coalesced in a single UDP datagram, especially
during the handshake (see {{Section 12.2 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}). However, neither
QUIC nor UDP themselves provide an explicit mechanism to track this behaviour.
To make it possible for implementations to track coalescing across packet-level
and datagram-level qlog events, this document defines a qlog-specific mechanism
for tracking coalescing across packet-level and datagram-level qlog events: a
"datagram identifier" carried in `datagram_id` fields. qlog implementations that
want to track coalescing can use this mechanism, where multiple events sharing
the same `datagram_id` indicate they were coalesced in the same UDP datagram.
The selection of specific and locally-unique `datagram_id` values is an
implementation choice.

## udp_datagrams_received {#quic-udpdatagramsreceived}

When one or more UDP-level datagrams are received from the socket. This is
useful for determining how datagrams are passed to the user space stack from the
OS. The event has Extra importance level; see {{Section 9.2 of QLOG-MAIN}}.

When a UDP-level datagram is dropped. This is typically done if it does not
contain a valid QUIC packet. If it does, but the QUIC packet is dropped for
other reasons, the `packet_dropped` event ({{quic-packetdropped}}) should be
used instead. The event has Extra importance level; see {{Section 9.2 of

## stream_state_updated {#quic-streamstateupdated}

The `stream_state_updated` event is emitted whenever the internal state of a
QUIC stream is updated; see {{Section 3 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}. Most of this can be
inferred from several types of frames going over the wire, but it's much easier
to have explicit signals for these state changes. The event has Base importance
level; see {{Section 9.2 of QLOG-MAIN}}.

~~~ cddl

$StreamState /= BaseStreamStates / GranularStreamStates
~~~
{: #quic-streamstateupdated-def title="QUICStreamStateUpdated definition"}

QUIC implementations SHOULD mainly log the simplified (HTTP/2-alike)
BaseStreamStates instead of the more fine-grained GranularStreamStates. These
latter ones are mainly for more in-depth debugging. Tools SHOULD be able to deal
with both types equally.

## frames_processed {#quic-framesprocessed}

The `frame_processed` event is intended to prevent a large proliferation of
specific purpose events (e.g., `packets_acknowledged`, `flow_control_updated`,
`stream_data_received`). It has Extra importance level; see {{Section 9.2 of
QLOG-MAIN}}.

Implementations have the opportunity to (selectively) log this type of
signal without having to log packet-level details (e.g., in `packet_received`).
Since for almost all cases, the effects of applying a frame to the internal state
of an implementation can be inferred from that frame's contents, these events
are aggregated into this single `frames_processed` event.

The `frame_processed` event can be used to signal internal state change not
resulting directly from the actual "parsing" of a frame (e.g., the frame could
have been parsed, data put into a buffer, then later processed, then logged with
this event).

The `packet_received` event can convey all constituent frames. It is not
expected that the `frames_processed` event will also be used for a redundant
purpose. Rather, implementations can use this event to avoid having to log full
packets or to convey extra information about when frames are processed (for
example, if frame processing is deferred for any reason).

Note that for some events, this approach will lose some information (e.g., for which
encryption level are packets being acknowledged?). If this information is
important, the `packet_received` event can be used instead.

In some implementations, it can be difficult to log frames directly, even when
using `packet_sent` and `packet_received` events. For these cases, the
`frames_processed` event also contains the `packet_numbers` field, which can be
used to more explicitly link this event to the `packet_sent`/`received events`.
The field is an array, which supports using a single `frames_processed` event
for multiple frames received over multiple packets. To map between frames and
packets, the position and order of entries in the `frames` and `packet_numbers`
is used. If the optional `packet_numbers` field is used, each frame MUST have a
corresponding packet number at the same index.

~~~ cddl
QUICFramesProcessed = {
    frames: [* $QuicFrame]
    ? packet_numbers: [* uint64]

    * $$quic-framesprocessed-extension
}
~~~
{: #quic-framesprocessed-def title="QUICFramesProcessed definition"}

For example, an instance of the `frames_processed` event that represents four
STREAM frames received over two packets would have the fields serialized as:

~~~
"frames":[
  {"frame_type":"stream","stream_id":0,"offset":0,"length":500},
  {"frame_type":"stream","stream_id":0,"offset":500,"length":200},
  {"frame_type":"stream","stream_id":1,"offset":0,"length":300},
  {"frame_type":"stream","stream_id":1,"offset":300,"length":50}
  ],
"packet_numbers":[
  1,
  1,
  2,
  2
]
~~~

## stream_data_moved {#quic-streamdatamoved}

The `stream_data_moved` event is used to indicate when QUIC stream data moves
between the different layers. This helps make clear the flow of data, how long
data remains in various buffers, and the overheads introduced by individual
layers. The event has Base importance level; see {{Section 9.2 of QLOG-MAIN}}.

This event relates to stream data only. There are no packet or frame headers and
length values in the `length` or `raw` fields MUST reflect that.

For example, it can be useful to understand when data moves from an
application protocol (e.g., HTTP) to QUIC stream buffers and vice versa.

The `stream_data_moved` event can provide insight into whether received data on
a QUIC stream is moved to the application protocol immediately (for example per
received packet) or in larger batches (for example, all QUIC packets are
processed first and afterwards the application layer reads from the streams with
newly available data). This can help identify bottlenecks, flow control issues,
or scheduling problems.

The `additional_info` field supports optional logging of information
related to the stream state. For example, an application layer that moves data
into transport and simultaneously ends the stream, can log `fin_set`. As
another example, a transport layer that has received an instruction to reset a
stream can indicate this to the application layer using `reset_stream`.
In both cases, the length-carrying fields (`length` or `raw`) can be
omitted or contain zero values.

This event is only for data in QUIC streams. For data in QUIC Datagram Frames,
see the `datagram_data_moved` event defined in {{quic-datagramdatamoved}}.

overheads introduced by individual layers. The event has Base importance level;

This event relates to datagram data only. There are no packet or frame headers and
length values in the `length` or `raw` fields MUST reflect that.

For example, passing from the application protocol (e.g., WebTransport) to QUIC
Datagram Frame buffers and vice versa.

The `datagram_data_moved` event can provide insight into whether received data
in a QUIC Datagram Frame is moved to the application protocol immediately (for
example per received packet) or in larger batches (for example, all QUIC packets
are processed first and afterwards the application layer reads all Datagrams at
once). This can help identify bottlenecks, flow control issues, or scheduling
problems.

## migration_state_updated {#quic-migrationstateupdated}
Importance: Extra

Use to provide additional information when attempting (client-side) connection
migration. While most details of the QUIC connection migration process can be
inferred by observing the PATH_CHALLENGE and PATH_RESPONSE frames, in
combination with the ConnectivityPathAssigned event, it can be useful to
explicitly log the progression of the migration and potentially made decisions
in a single location/event.

Generally speaking, connection migration goes through two phases: a probing
phase (which is not always needed/present), and a migration phase (which can be
abandoned upon error).

Implementations that log per-path information in a QUICMigrationStateUpdated,
SHOULD also emit QUICPathAssigned events, to serve as a ground-truth source of
information.

The `parameters_set` event groups initial parameters from both loss detection
and congestion control into a single event. It has Base importance level; see
{{Section 9.2 of QLOG-MAIN}}.

All these settings are typically set once and never change. Implementation that
do, for some reason, change these parameters during execution, MAY emit the
`parameters_set` event more than once.

    ; as PTO multiplier
    ? persistent_congestion_threshold: uint16

    * $$recovery-parametersset-extension
}
~~~
{: #recovery-parametersset-def title="RecoveryParametersSet definition"}

Additionally, this event can contain any number of unspecified fields to support
different recovery approaches.

## metrics_updated {#recovery-metricsupdated}

The `metrics_updated` event is emitted when one or more of the observable
recovery metrics changes value. It has Core importance level; see {{Section
9.2 of QLOG-MAIN}}.

This event SHOULD group all possible metric updates that happen at or around the
same time in a single event (e.g., if `min_rtt` and `smoothed_rtt` change at the
same time, they should be bundled in a single `metrics_updated` entry, rather
than split out into two). Consequently, a `metrics_updated` event is only
guaranteed to contain at least one of the listed metrics.

~~~ cddl
RecoveryMetricsUpdated = {

    ; Loss detection, see RFC 9002 Appendix A.3
    ; all following rtt fields are expressed in ms
    ? min_rtt: float32
    ? smoothed_rtt: float32
    ? latest_rtt: float32
    ? rtt_variance: float32
    ? pto_count: uint16

    ; Congestion control, see RFC 9002 Appendix B.2.
    ; in bytes
    ? congestion_window: uint64
    ? bytes_in_flight: uint64

    ; in bytes
    ? ssthresh: uint64

    ; qlog defined
    ; sum of all packet number spaces
    ? packets_in_flight: uint64

    ; in bits per second
    ? pacing_rate: uint64

    * $$recovery-metricsupdated-extension
}
~~~
{: #recovery-metricsupdated-def title="RecoveryMetricsUpdated definition"}

In order to make logging easier, implementations MAY log values even if they are the
same as previously reported values (e.g., two subsequent RecoveryMetricsUpdated entries can
both report the exact same value for `min_rtt`). However, applications SHOULD try to
log only actual updates to values.

Additionally, the `metrics_updated` event can contain any number of unspecified fields to support
different recovery approaches.

## congestion_state_updated {#recovery-congestionstateupdated}

The `congestion_state_updated` event indicates when the congestion controller
enters a significant new state and changes its behaviour. It has Base importance
level; see {{Section 9.2 of QLOG-MAIN}}.

The values of the event's fields are intentionally unspecified here in order to
support different Congestion Control algorithms, as these typically have
different states and even different implementations of these states across
stacks. For example, for the algorithm defined in the Recovery draft ("enhanced"
New Reno), the following states are used: Slow Start, Congestion Avoidance,
Application Limited and Recovery. Similarly, states can be triggered by a
variety of events, including detection of Persistent Congestion or receipt of
ECN markings.

~~~ cddl
RecoveryCongestionStateUpdated = {
    ? old: text
    new: text
    ? trigger: text

    * $$recovery-congestionstateupdated-extension
}
~~~
{: #recovery-congestionstateupdated-def title="RecoveryCongestionStateUpdated definition"}

The `trigger` field SHOULD be logged if there are multiple ways in which a state
change can occur but MAY be omitted if a given state can only be due to a single
event occurring (for example Slow Start is often exited only when ssthresh is
exceeded).

## loss_timer_updated {#recovery-losstimerupdated}

The `loss_timer_updated` event is emitted when a recovery loss timer changes
state. It has Extra importance level; see {{Section 9.2 of QLOG-MAIN}}.

The three main event types are:

* set: the timer is set with a delta timeout for when it will trigger next
* expired: when the timer effectively expires after the delta timeout
* cancelled: when a timer is cancelled (e.g., all outstanding packets are
  acknowledged, start idle period)

In order to indicate an active timer's timeout update, a new `set` event is used.

~~~ cddl
RecoveryLossTimerUpdated = {

    ; called "mode" in RFC 9002 A.9.
    ? timer_type: "ack" /
                  "pto"
    ? packet_number_space: $PacketNumberSpace
    event_type: "set" /
                "expired" /
                "cancelled"

    ; if event_type === "set": delta time is in ms from
    ; this event's timestamp until when the timer will trigger
    ? delta: float32

    * $$recovery-losstimerupdated-extension
}
~~~
{: #recovery-losstimerupdated-def title="RecoveryLossTimerUpdated definition"}

## packet_lost {#recovery-packetlost}

The `packet_lost` event is emitted when a packet is deemed lost by loss
detection. It has Core importance level; see {{Section 9.2 of QLOG-MAIN}}.

It is RECOMMENDED to populate the optional `trigger` field in order to help
disambiguate among the various possible causes of a loss declaration.

~~~ cddl
RecoveryPacketLost = {

    ; should include at least the packet_type and packet_number
    ? header: PacketHeader

    ; not all implementations will keep track of full
    ; packets, so these are optional
    ? frames: [* $QuicFrame]
    ? is_mtu_probe_packet: bool .default false
    ? trigger:
        "reordering_threshold" /
        "time_threshold" /

        "pto_expired"

    * $$recovery-packetlost-extension
}
~~~
{: #recovery-packetlost-def title="RecoveryPacketLost definition"}

## marked_for_retransmit {#recovery-markedforretransmit}

The `marked_for_retransmit` event indicates which data was marked for
retransmission upon detection of packet loss (see `packet_lost`). It has Extra
importance level; see {{Section 9.2 of QLOG-MAIN}}.

Similar to the reasoning for the `frames_processed` event,
in order to keep the amount of different events low, this signal is grouped into
in a single event based on existing QUIC frame definitions for all types of
retransmittable data.

Implementations retransmitting full packets or frames directly can just log the
constituent frames of the lost packet here (or do away with this event and use the
contents of the `packet_lost` event instead). Conversely, implementations that have
more complex logic (e.g., marking ranges in a stream's data buffer as in-flight),
or that do not track sent frames in full (e.g., only stream offset + length), can
translate their internal behaviour into the appropriate frame instance here even
if that frame was never or will never be put on the wire.

Much of this data can be inferred if implementations log `packet_sent` events
(e.g., looking at overlapping stream data offsets and length, one can determine
when data was retransmitted).

## ecn_state_updated {#recovery-ecnstateupdated}

The `ecn_state_updated` event indicates a progression in the ECN state machine
as described in section A.4 of {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}. It has Extra importance
level; see {{Section 9.2 of QLOG-MAIN}}.

PathEndpointInfo indicates a single half/direction of a path. A full path is
comprised of two halves. Firstly: the server sends to the remote client IP

As such, structures logging path information SHOULD include two different
PathEndpointInfo instances, one for each half of the path.

### PaddingFrame

In QUIC, PADDING frames are simply identified as a single byte of value 0. As
such, each padding byte could be theoretically interpreted and logged as an
individual PaddingFrame.

However, as this leads to heavy logging overhead, implementations SHOULD instead
emit just a single PaddingFrame and set the payload_length property to the amount
of PADDING bytes/frames included in the packet.

~~~ cddl
PaddingFrame = {
    frame_type: "padding"

    ; total frame length, including frame header

### PingFrame

~~~ cddl
PingFrame = {
    frame_type: "ping"

    ; total frame length, including frame header
    ? length: uint32
    ? payload_length: uint32
}
~~~
{: #pingframe-def title="PingFrame definition"}

### AckFrame

~~~ cddl
; either a single number (e.g., [1]) or two numbers (e.g., [1,2]).
; For two numbers:
; the first number is "from": lowest packet number in interval
; the second number is "to": up to and including the highest
; packet number in the interval
AckRange = [1*2 uint64]

AckFrame = {
    frame_type: "ack"

    ; in ms
    ? ack_delay: float32

    ; e.g., looks like [[1,2],[4,5], [7], [10,22]] serialized
    ? acked_ranges: [+ AckRange]

    ; ECN (explicit congestion notification) related fields
    ; (not always present)

    ; total frame length, including frame header
    ? length: uint32
    ? payload_length: uint32
}
~~~
{: #ackframe-def title="AckFrame definition"}

Note that the packet ranges in AckFrame.acked_ranges do not necessarily have to be
ordered (e.g., \[\[5,9\],\[1,4\]\] is a valid value).

Note that the two numbers in the packet range can be the same (e.g., \[120,120\] means
that packet with number 120 was ACKed). However, in that case, implementers SHOULD
log \[120\] instead and tools MUST be able to deal with both notations.

### ConnectionCloseFrame

An endpoint that receives unknown error codes can record it in the error_code
field using the numerical value without variable-length integer encoding.

When the connection is closed due a connection-level error, the
`trigger_frame_type` field can be used to log the frame that triggered the
error. For known frame types, the appropriate string value is used. For unknown
frame types, the numerical value without variable-length integer encoding is
used.

The CONNECTION_CLOSE reason phrase is a byte sequences. It is likely that this
sequence is presentable as UTF-8, in which case it can be logged in the `reason`
field. The `reason_bytes` field supports logging the raw bytes, which can be useful
when the value is not UTF-8 or when an endpoint does not want to decode it.
Implementations SHOULD log at least one format, but MAY log both or none.

### ApplicationError

By definition, an application error is defined by the application-level
protocol running on top of QUIC (e.g., HTTP/3).

As such, it cannot be defined here directly. It is instead defined as an empty
CDDL "type socket" extension point.

Application-level qlog definitions that wish to define new ApplicationError
strings MUST do so by extending the $ApplicationError socket as such:

~~~~~~
$ApplicationError /= "new_error_name" /
                     "another_new_error_name"
~~~~~~

### CryptoError

These errors are defined in the TLS document as "A TLS alert is turned into a QUIC
connection error by converting the one-byte alert description into a QUIC error
code. The alert description is added to 0x100 to produce a QUIC error code from
the range reserved for CRYPTO_ERROR."

This approach maps badly to a pre-defined enum. As such, the crypto_error
string is defined as having a dynamic component here, which should include the
hex-encoded and zero-padded value of the TLS alert description.

~~~ cddl
; all strings from "crypto_error_0x100" to "crypto_error_0x1ff"
CryptoError = text .regexp "crypto_error_0x1[0-9a-f][0-9a-f]"

## Since draft-marx-qlog-event-definitions-quic-h3-01:
{:numbered="false"}

Major changes:

* Moved data_moved from http to transport. Also made the "from" and "to" fields
  flexible strings instead of an enum (#111,#65)
* Moved packet_type fields to PacketHeader. Moved packet_size field out of
  PacketHeader to RawInfo:length (#40)
* Made events that need to log packet_type and packet_number use a header field
  instead of logging these fields individually
* Added support for logging retry, stateless reset and initial tokens (#94,#86,#117)
* Moved separate general event categories into a single category "generic" (#47)
* Added "transport:connection_closed" event (#43,#85,#78,#49)
* Added version_information and alpn_information events (#85,#75,#28)
* Added parameters_restored events to help clarify 0-RTT behaviour (#88)

Smaller changes:

* Merged loss_timer events into one loss_timer_updated event
* Field data types are now strongly defined (#10,#39,#36,#115)
* Renamed qpack instruction_received and instruction_sent to instruction_created
  and instruction_parsed (#114)
* Updated qpack:dynamic_table_updated.update_type. It now has the value "inserted"
  instead of "added" (#113)
* Updated qpack:dynamic_table_updated. It now has an "owner" field to
  differentiate encoder vs decoder state (#112)
* Removed push_allowed from http:parameters_set (#110)
* Removed explicit trigger field indications from events, since this was moved to
  be a generic property of the "data" field (#80)
* Updated transport:connection_id_updated to be more in line with other similar
  events. Also dropped importance from Core to Base (#45)
* Added length property to PaddingFrame (#34)
* Added packet_number field to transport:frames_processed (#74)
* Added a way to generically log packet header flags (first 8 bits) to
  PacketHeader
* Added additional guidance on which events to log in which situations (#53)
* Added "simulation:scenario" event to help indicate simulation details
* Added "packets_acked" event (#107)
* Added "datagram_ids" to the datagram_X and packet_X events to allow tracking of
  coalesced QUIC packets (#91)
* Extended connection_state_updated with more fine-grained states (#49)

## Since draft-marx-qlog-event-definitions-quic-h3-00:
{:numbered="false"}

* Event and category names are now all lowercase
* Added many new events and their definitions
* "type" fields have been made more specific (especially important for PacketType
  fields, which are now called packet_type instead of type)
* Events are given an importance indicator (issue \#22)
* Event names are more consistent and use past tense (issue \#21)
* Triggers have been redefined as properties of the "data" field and updated for most events (issue \#23)
