1.  Introduction

   This document describes the values of the qlog name ("category" +
   "event") and "data" fields and their semantics for the QUIC protocol
   (see [QUIC-TRANSPORT], [QUIC-RECOVERY], and [QUIC-TLS]) and some of
   its extensions (see [QUIC-DATAGRAM] and [GREASEBIT]).

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The event and data structure definitions in ths document are
   expressed in the Concise Data Definition Language [CDDL] and its
   extensions described in [QLOG-MAIN].

   The following fields from [QLOG-MAIN] are imported and used: name,
   category, type, data, group_id, protocol_type, importance, RawInfo,
   and time-related fields.

2.  Overview

   This document describes how the QUIC protocol can be expressed in
   qlog using the schema defined in [QLOG-MAIN].  QUIC protocol events
   are defined with a category, a name (the concatenation of "category"
   and "event"), an "importance", an optional "trigger", and "data"
   fields.

   Some data fields use complex datastructures.  These are represented
   as enums or re-usable definitions, which are grouped together on the
   bottom of this document for clarity.

   When any event from this document is included in a qlog trace, the
   protocol_type qlog array field MUST contain an entry with the value
   "QUIC".

   When the qlog group_id field is used, it is recommended to use QUIC's
   Original Destination Connection ID (ODCID, the CID chosen by the
   client when first contacting the server), as this is the only value
   that does not change over the course of the connection and can be
   used to link more advanced QUIC packets (e.g., Retry, Version
   Negotiation) to a given connection.  Similarly, the ODCID should be
   used as the qlog filename or file identifier, potentially suffixed by
   the vantagepoint type (For example, abcd1234_server.qlog would
   contain the server-side trace of the connection with ODCID abcd1234).

2.1.  Raw packet and frame information

   QUIC packets always include an AEAD authentication tag at the end.
   In general, the length of the AEAD tag depends on the TLS cipher
   suite, although all cipher suites used in QUIC v1 use a 16 byte tag.

   Note:  As QUIC appends an authentication tag after the packet
      payload, the packet header_lengths can be calculated as:

      header_length = length - payload_length - 16

      For UDP datagrams, the calculation is simpler:

      header_length = length - payload_length

   Note:  In some cases, the length fields are also explicitly reflected
      inside of packet headers.  For example, the QUIC STREAM frame has
      a length field indicating its payload size.  Similarly, the QUIC
      Long Header has a length field which is equal to the payload
      length plus the packet number length.  In these cases, those
      fields are intentionally preserved in the event definitions.  Even
      though this can lead to duplicate data when the full RawInfo is
      logged, it allows a more direct mapping of the QUIC specifications
      to qlog, making it easier for users to interpret.

2.2.  Events not belonging to a single connection

   A single qlog event trace is typically associated with a single QUIC
   connection.  However, for several types of events (for example, a
   Section 5.7 event with trigger value of connection_unknown), it can
   be impossible to tie them to a specific QUIC connection, especially
   on the server.

   There are various ways to handle these events, each making certain
   tradeoffs between file size overhead, flexibility, ease of use, or
   ease of implementation.  Some options include:

   *  Log them in a separate endpoint-wide trace (or use a special
      group_id value) not associated with a single connection.

   *  Log them in the most recently used trace.

   *  Use additional heuristics for connection identification (for
      example use the four-tuple in addition to the Connection ID).

   *  Buffer events until they can be assigned to a connection (for
      example for version negotiation and retry events).

3.  QUIC Event Overview

   QUIC connections consist of different phases and interaction events.
   In order to model this, QUIC event types are divided into general
   categories: connectivity (Section 4), security (Section 6), quic
   Section 5, and recovery Section 7.

   As described in Section 3.4.2 of [QLOG-MAIN], the qlog name field is
   the concatenation of category and type.

   Table 1 summarizes the name value of each event type that is defined
   in this specification.

4.  Connectivity events

4.1.  server_listening

   Emitted when the server starts accepting connections.  It has Extra
   importance level; see Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   ConnectivityServerListening = {
       ? ip_v4: IPAddress
       ? ip_v6: IPAddress
       ? port_v4: uint16
       ? port_v6: uint16

       ; the server will always answer client initials with a retry
       ; (no 1-RTT connection setups by choice)
       ? retry_required: bool
   }

              Figure 2: ConnectivityServerListening definition

   Some QUIC stacks do not handle sockets directly and are thus unable
   to log IP and/or port information.

4.2.  connection_started

   The connection_started event is used for both attempting (client-
   perspective) and accepting (server-perspective) new connections.
   Note that while there is overlap with the connection_state_updated
   event, this event is separate event in order to capture additional
   data that can be useful to log.  It has Base importance level; see
   Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   ConnectivityConnectionStarted = {
       ? ip_version: IPVersion
       src_ip: IPAddress
       dst_ip: IPAddress

       ; transport layer protocol
       ? protocol: text .default "QUIC"
       ? src_port: uint16
       ? dst_port: uint16
       ? src_cid: ConnectionID
       ? dst_cid: ConnectionID
   }

             Figure 3: ConnectivityConnectionStarted definition

   Some QUIC stacks do not handle sockets directly and are thus unable
   to log IP and/or port information.

4.3.  connection_closed

   The connection_closed event is used for logging when a connection was
   closed, typically when an error or timeout occurred.  It has Base
   importance level; see Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   Note that this event has overlap with the connection_state_updated
   event, as well as the CONNECTION_CLOSE frame.  However, in practice,
   when analyzing large deployments, it can be useful to have a single
   event representing a connection_closed event, which also includes an
   additional reason field to provide more information.  Furthermore, it
   is useful to log closures due to timeouts, which are difficult to
   reflect using the other options.

   In QUIC there are two main connection-closing error categories:
   connection and application errors.  They have well-defined error
   codes and semantics.  Next to these however, there can be internal
   errors that occur that may or may not get mapped to the official
   error codes in implementation-specific ways.  As such, multiple error
   codes can be set on the same event to reflect this.

   ConnectivityConnectionClosed = {

             Figure 4: ConnectivityConnectionClosed definition

4.4.  connection_id_updated

   The connection_id_updated event is emitted when either party updates
   their current Connection ID.  As this typically happens only
   sparingly over the course of a connection, using this event is more
   efficient than logging the observed CID with each and every
   packet_sent or packet_received events.  It has Base importance level;
   see Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   The connection_id_updated event is viewed from the perspective of the
   endpoint applying the new ID.  As such, when the endpoint receives a
   new connection ID from the peer, it will see the dst_ fields are set.
   When the endpoint updates its own connection ID (e.g.,
   NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame), it logs the src_ fields.

   ConnectivityConnectionIDUpdated = {
       owner: Owner
       ? old: ConnectionID
       ? new: ConnectionID
   }

            Figure 5: ConnectivityConnectionIDUpdated definition

4.5.  spin_bit_updated

   The spin_bit_updated event conveys information about the QUIC latency
   spin bit; see Section 17.4 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  The event is emitted
   when the spin bit changes value, it SHOULD NOT be emitted if the spin
   bit is set without changing its value.  It has Base importance level;
   see Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   ConnectivitySpinBitUpdated = {
       state: bool
   }

              Figure 6: ConnectivitySpinBitUpdated definition

4.6.  connection_state_updated

   The connection_state_updated event is used to track progress through
   QUIC's complex handshake and connection close procedures.  It has
   Base importance level; see Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   It is intended to provide exhaustive options to log each state
   individually, but also provides a more basic, simpler set for
   implementations less interested in tracking each smaller state
   transition.  As such, users should not expect to see all these states
   reflected in all qlogs and implementers should focus on support for
   the SimpleConnectionState set.

   ConnectivityConnectionStateUpdated = {
       ? old: ConnectionState /
              SimpleConnectionState
       new: ConnectionState /
            SimpleConnectionState
   }

   ConnectionState =
       ; initial sent/received
       "attempted" /
       ; peer address validated by: client sent Handshake packet OR
       ; client used CONNID chosen by the server.
       ; RFC 9000 Section 8.1
       "peer_validated" /
       "handshake_started" /
       ; 1 RTT can be sent, but handshake isn't done yet
       "early_write" /
       ; TLS handshake complete: Finished received and sent
       ; RFC 9001 Section 4.1.1
       "handshake_complete" /
       ; HANDSHAKE_DONE sent/received (connection is now "active", 1RTT
       ; can be sent). RFC 9001 Section 4.1.2
       "handshake_confirmed" /
       "closing" /
       ; connection_close sent/received
       "draining" /
       ; draining period done, connection state discarded
       "closed"

   SimpleConnectionState =
       "attempted" /
       "handshake_started" /
       "handshake_confirmed" /
       "closed"

          Figure 7: ConnectivityConnectionStateUpdated definition

   These states correspond to the following transitions for both client
   and server:

   *Client:*

   *  send initial

      -  state = attempted

   *  get initial

      -  state = validated _(not really "needed" at the client, but
         somewhat useful to indicate progress nonetheless)_

   *  get first Handshake packet

      -  state = handshake_started

   *  get Handshake packet containing ServerFinished

      -  state = handshake_complete

   *  send ClientFinished

      -  state = early_write (1RTT can now be sent)

   *  get HANDSHAKE_DONE

      -  state = handshake_confirmed

   *Server:*

   *  get initial

      -  state = attempted

   *  send initial _(TODO don't think this needs a separate state, since
      some handshake will always be sent in the same flight as this?)_

   *  send handshake EE, CERT, CV, ...

      -  state = handshake_started

   *  send ServerFinished

      -  state = early_write (1RTT can now be sent)

   *  get first handshake packet / something using a server-issued CID
      of min length

      -  state = validated

   *  get handshake packet containing ClientFinished

      -  state = handshake_complete

   *  send HANDSHAKE_DONE

      -  state = handshake_confirmed

   Note:  connection_state_changed with a new state of attempted is the
      same conceptual event as the connection_startedevent above from
      the client's perspective.  Similarly, a state
      ofclosingordrainingcorresponds to theconnection_closed` event.

4.7.  mtu_updated

   The mtu_updated event indicates that the estimated Path MTU was
   updated.  This happens as part of the Path MTU discovery process.  It
   has Extra importance level; see Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   ConnectivityMTUUpdated = {
     ? old: uint32
     new: uint32

     ; at some point, MTU discovery stops, as a "good enough"
     ; packet size has been found
     ? done: bool .default false
   }

                Figure 8: ConnectivityMTUUpdated definition

5.  QUIC events

5.1.  version_information

   The version_information event supports QUIC version negotiation; see
   Section 6 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  It has Core importance level; see
   Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   QUIC endpoints each have their own list of QUIC versions they
   support.  The client uses the most likely version in their first
   initial.  If the server does not support that version, it replies
   with a Version Negotiation packet, which contains its supported
   versions.  From this, the client selects a version.  The
   version_information event aggregates all this information in a single
   event type.  It also allows logging of supported versions at an
   endpoint without actual version negotiation needing to happen.

   QUICVersionInformation = {
       ? server_versions: [+ QuicVersion]
       ? client_versions: [+ QuicVersion]
       ? chosen_version: QuicVersion
   }

                Figure 9: QUICVersionInformation definition

   Intended use:

   *  When sending an initial, the client logs this event with
      client_versions and chosen_version set

   *  Upon receiving a client initial with a supported version, the
      server logs this event with server_versions and chosen_version set

   *  Upon receiving a client initial with an unsupported version, the
      server logs this event with server_versions set and
      client_versions to the single-element array containing the
      client's attempted version.  The absence of chosen_version implies
      no overlap was found

   *  Upon receiving a version negotiation packet from the server, the
      client logs this event with client_versions set and
      server_versions to the versions in the version negotiation packet
      and chosen_version to the version it will use for the next initial
      packet.  If the client receives a set of server_versions with no
      viable overlap with its own supported versions, this event should
      be logged without the chosen_version set

5.2.  alpn_information

   The alpn_information event supports Application-Layer Protocol
   Negotiation (ALPN) over the QUIC transport; see [RFC7301] and
   Section 7.4 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  It has Core importance level; see
   Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   QUIC endpoints are configured with a list of supported ALPN
   identifiers.  Clients send the list in a TLS ClientHello, and servers
   match against their list.  On success, a single ALPN identifier is
   chosen and sent back in a TLS ServerHello.  If no match is found, the
   connection is closed.

   ALPN identifiers are byte sequences, that may be possible to present
   as UTF-8.  The ALPNIdentifier` type supports either format.
   Implementations SHOULD log at least one format, but MAY log both or
   none.

   QUICALPNInformation = {
       ? server_alpns: [* ALPNIdentifier]
       ? client_alpns: [* ALPNIdentifier]
       ? chosen_alpn: ALPNIdentifier
   }

   ALPNIdentifier = {
     ? byte_value: hexstring
     ? string_value: text
   }

                 Figure 10: QUICALPNInformation definition

   Intended use:

   *  When sending an initial, the client logs this event with
      client_alpns set

   *  When receiving an initial with a supported alpn, the server logs
      this event with server_alpns set, client_alpns equalling the
      client-provided list, and chosen_alpn to the value it will send
      back to the client.

   *  When receiving an initial with an alpn, the client logs this event
      with chosen_alpn to the received value.

   *  Alternatively, a client can choose to not log the first event, but
      wait for the receipt of the server initial to log this event with
      both client_alpns and chosen_alpn set.

5.3.  parameters_set

   The parameters_set event groups settings from several different
   sources (transport parameters, TLS ciphers, etc.) into a single
   event.  This is done to minimize the amount of events and to decouple
   conceptual setting impacts from their underlying mechanism for easier
   high-level reasoning.  The event has Core importance level; see
   Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   All these settings are typically set once and never change.  However,
   they are typically set at different times during the connection, so
   there will typically be several instances of this event with
   different fields set.

   Note that some settings have two variations (one set locally, one
   requested by the remote peer).  This is reflected in the owner field.
   As such, this field MUST be correct for all settings included a
   single event instance.  If you need to log settings from two sides,
   you MUST emit two separate event instances.

   In the case of connection resumption and 0-RTT, some of the server's
   parameters are stored up-front at the client and used for the initial
   connection startup.  They are later updated with the server's reply.
   In these cases, utilize the separate parameters_restored event to
   indicate the initial values, and this event to indicate the updated
   values, as normal.

   QUICParametersSet = {
       ? owner: Owner

       ; true if valid session ticket was received
       ? resumption_allowed: bool

       ; true if early data extension was enabled on the TLS layer
       ? early_data_enabled: bool

       ; e.g., "AES_128_GCM_SHA256"

       ; RFC9221
       ? max_datagram_frame_size: uint64

       ; RFC9287
       ; true if present, absent or false if extension not negotiated
       ? grease_quic_bit: bool
   }

   PreferredAddress = {
       ip_v4: IPAddress
       ip_v6: IPAddress
       port_v4: uint16
       port_v6: uint16
       connection_id: ConnectionID
       stateless_reset_token: StatelessResetToken
   }

                  Figure 11: QUICParametersSet definition

   Additionally, this event can contain any number of unspecified
   fields.  This is to reflect setting of, for example, unknown
   (greased) transport parameters or custom extensions.

5.4.  parameters_restored

   When using QUIC 0-RTT, clients are expected to remember and restore
   the server's transport parameters from the previous connection.  The
   parameters_restored event is used to indicate which parameters were
   restored and to which values when utilizing 0-RTT.  It has Base
   importance level; see Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   Note that not all transport parameters should be restored (many are
   even prohibited from being re-utilized).  The ones listed here are
   the ones expected to be useful for correct 0-RTT usage.

   QUICParametersRestored = {
       ? disable_active_migration: bool
       ? max_idle_timeout: uint64
       ? max_udp_payload_size: uint32
       ? active_connection_id_limit: uint32
       ? initial_max_data: uint64
       ? initial_max_stream_data_bidi_local: uint64
       ? initial_max_stream_data_bidi_remote: uint64,
       ? initial_max_stream_data_uni: uint64
       ? initial_max_streams_bidi: uint64
       ? initial_max_streams_uni: uint64
   }

                Figure 12: QUICParametersRestored definition

   Note that, like the parameters_set event, this event can contain any
   number of unspecified fields to allow for additional/custom
   parameters.

5.5.  packet_sent

   The packet_sent event indicates a QUIC-level packet was sent.  It has
   Core importance level; see Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   QUICPacketSent = {
       header: PacketHeader
       ? frames: [* $QuicFrame]
       ? is_coalesced: bool .default false

       ; only if header.packet_type === "stateless_reset"
       ; is always 128 bits in length.
       ? stateless_reset_token: StatelessResetToken

       ; only if header.packet_type === "version_negotiation"
       ? supported_versions: [+ QuicVersion]
       ? raw: RawInfo
       ? datagram_id: uint32
       ? is_mtu_probe_packet: bool .default false

       ? trigger:
         ; RFC 9002 Section 6.1.1
         "retransmit_reordered" /
         ; RFC 9002 Section 6.1.2
         "retransmit_timeout" /
         ; RFC 9002 Section 6.2.4
         "pto_probe" /
         ; RFC 9002 6.2.3
         "retransmit_crypto" /
         ; needed for some CCs to figure out bandwidth allocations
         ; when there are no normal sends
         "cc_bandwidth_probe"
   }

                    Figure 13: QUICPacketSent definition

   The encryption_level and packet_number_space are not logged
   explicitly: the header.packet_type specifies this by inference
   (assuming correct implementation)

   For more details on datagram_id, see Section 5.10.  It is only needed
   when keeping track of packet coalescing.

5.6.  packet_received

   The packet_received event indicates a QUIC-level packet was received.
   It has Core importance level; see Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   QUICPacketReceived = {
       header: PacketHeader
       ? frames: [* $QuicFrame]
       ? is_coalesced: bool .default false

       ; only if header.packet_type === "stateless_reset"
       ; Is always 128 bits in length.
       ? stateless_reset_token: StatelessResetToken

       ; only if header.packet_type === "version_negotiation"
       ? supported_versions: [+ QuicVersion]
       ? raw: RawInfo
       ? datagram_id: uint32

       ? trigger:
           ; if packet was buffered because it couldn't be
           ; decrypted before
           "keys_available"
   }

                  Figure 14: QUICPacketReceived definition

   The encryption_level and packet_number_space are not logged
   explicitly: the header.packet_type specifies this by inference
   (assuming correct implementation)

   For more details on datagram_id, see Section 5.10.  It is only needed
   when keeping track of packet coalescing.

5.7.  packet_dropped

   The packet_dropped event indicates a QUIC-level packet was dropped.
   It has Base importance level; see Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   The trigger field indicates a general reason category for dropping
   the packet, while the details field can contain additional
   implementation-specific information.

   QUICPacketDropped = {

       ; Primarily packet_type should be filled here,
       ; as other fields might not be decrypteable or parseable
       ? header: PacketHeader
       ? raw: RawInfo
       ? datagram_id: uint32
       ? details: {* text => any}
       ? trigger:
           "internal_error" /
           "rejected" /
           "unsupported" /
           "invalid" /
           "duplicate" /
           "connection_unknown" /
           "decryption_failure" /
           "key_unavailable" /
           "general"
   }

                  Figure 15: QUICPacketDropped definition

   Some example situations for each of the trigger categories include:

   *  internal_error: not initialized, out of memory

   *  rejected: limits reached, DDoS protection, unwilling to track more
      paths, duplicate packet

   *  unsupported: unknown or unsupported version.  See also
      Section 2.2.

   *  invalid: packet parsing or validation error

   *  duplicate: duplicate packet

   *  connection_unknown: packet does not relate to a known connection
      or Connection ID

   *  decryption_failure: decryption failed

   *  key_unavailable: decryption key was unavailable

   *  general: situations not clearly covered in the other categories

   For more details on datagram_id, see Section 5.10.

5.8.  packet_buffered

   The packet_buffered event is emitted when a packet is buffered
   because it cannot be processed yet.  Typically, this is because the
   packet cannot be parsed yet, and thus only the full packet contents
   can be logged when it was parsed in a packet_received event.  The
   event has Base importance level; see Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   QUICPacketBuffered = {

       ; primarily packet_type and possible packet_number should be
       ; filled here as other elements might not be available yet
       ? header: PacketHeader
       ? raw: RawInfo
       ? datagram_id: uint32
       ? trigger:
           ; indicates the parser cannot keep up, temporarily buffers
           ; packet for later processing
           "backpressure" /
           ; if packet cannot be decrypted because the proper keys were
           ; not yet available
           "keys_unavailable"
   }

                  Figure 16: QUICPacketBuffered definition

   For more details on datagram_id, see Section 5.10.  It is only needed
   when keeping track of packet coalescing.

5.9.  packets_acked

   The packets_acked event is emitted when a (group of) sent packet(s)
   is acknowledged by the remote peer _for the first time_. It has Extra
   importance level; see Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   This information could also be deduced from the contents of received
   ACK frames.  However, ACK frames require additional processing logic
   to determine when a given packet is acknowledged for the first time,
   as QUIC uses ACK ranges which can include repeated ACKs.
   Additionally, this event can be used by implementations that do not
   log frame contents.

   QUICPacketsAcked = {
       ? packet_number_space: PacketNumberSpace
       ? packet_numbers: [+ uint64]
   }

                   Figure 17: QUICPacketsAcked definition

   If packet_number_space is omitted, it assumes the default value of
   PacketNumberSpace.application_data, as this is by far the most
   prevalent packet number space a typical QUIC connection will use.

5.10.  datagrams_sent

   When one or more UDP-level datagrams are passed to the socket.  This
   is useful for determining how QUIC packet buffers are drained to the
   OS.  The event has Extra importance level; see Section 9.2 of
   [QLOG-MAIN].

   QUICDatagramsSent = {

       ; to support passing multiple at once
       ? count: uint16

       ; The RawInfo fields do not include the UDP headers,
       ; only the UDP payload
       ? raw: [+ RawInfo]

       ; ECN bits in the IP header
       ; if not set, defaults to the value used on the last
       ; QUICDatagramsSent event
       ? ecn: [+ ECN]

       ? datagram_ids: [+ uint32]
   }

                  Figure 18: QUICDatagramsSent definition

   Since QUIC implementations rarely control UDP logic directly, the raw
   data excludes UDP-level headers in all fields.

   The datagram_id is a qlog-specific concept to allow tracking of QUIC
   packet coalescing inside UDP datagrams.  Since QUIC generates many
   UDP datagrams, unique identifiers are required to be able to track
   them individually in qlog traces.  However, neither UDP nor QUIC
   exchanges datagram identifiers on the wire.  Selecting identifier
   values is thus left to qlog implementations, which should consider
   how to generate unique values within the scope of their created
   traces.

5.11.  datagrams_received

   When one or more UDP-level datagrams are received from the socket.
   This is useful for determining how datagrams are passed to the user
   space stack from the OS.  The event has Extra importance level; see
   Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   QUICDatagramsReceived = {

       ; to support passing multiple at once
       ? count: uint16

       ; The RawInfo fields do not include the UDP headers,
       ; only the UDP payload
       ? raw: [+ RawInfo]

       ; ECN bits in the IP header
       ; if not set, defaults to the value on the last
       ; QUICDatagramsReceived event
       ? ecn: [+ ECN]

       ? datagram_ids: [+ uint32]
   }

                Figure 19: QUICDatagramsReceived definition

   For more details on datagram_ids, see Section 5.10.

5.12.  datagram_dropped

   When a UDP-level datagram is dropped.  This is typically done if it
   does not contain a valid QUIC packet.  If it does, but the QUIC
   packet is dropped for other reasons, the packet_dropped event
   (Section 5.7) should be used instead.  The event has Extra importance
   level; see Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   QUICDatagramDropped = {

       ; The RawInfo fields do not include the UDP headers,
       ; only the UDP payload
       ? raw: RawInfo
   }

5.13.  stream_state_updated

   The stream_state_updated event is emitted whenever the internal state
   of a QUIC stream is updated; see Section 3 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  Most
   of this can be inferred from several types of frames going over the
   wire, but it's much easier to have explicit signals for these state
   changes.  The event has Base importance level; see Section 9.2 of
   [QLOG-MAIN].

   StreamType = "unidirectional" /
                "bidirectional"

   QUICStreamStateUpdated = {
       stream_id: uint64

       ; mainly useful when opening the stream
       ? stream_type: StreamType
       ? old: StreamState
       new: StreamState
       ? stream_side: "sending" /
                      "receiving"
   }

   StreamState =
       ; bidirectional stream states, RFC 9000 Section 3.4.
       "idle" /
       "open" /
       "half_closed_local" /
       "half_closed_remote" /
       "closed" /
       ; sending-side stream states, RFC 9000 Section 3.1.
       "ready" /
       "send" /
       "data_sent" /
       "reset_sent" /
       "reset_received" /
       ; receive-side stream states, RFC 9000 Section 3.2.
       "receive" /
       "size_known" /
       "data_read" /
       "reset_read" /
       ; both-side states
       "data_received" /
       ; qlog-defined:
       ; memory actually freed
       "destroyed"

                Figure 21: QUICStreamStateUpdated definition

   QUIC implementations SHOULD mainly log the simplified bidirectional
   (HTTP/2-alike) stream states (e.g., idle, open, closed) instead of
   the more fine-grained stream states (e.g., data_sent,
   reset_received).  These latter ones are mainly for more in-depth
   debugging.  Tools SHOULD be able to deal with both types equally.

5.14.  frames_processed

   The frame_processed event is intended to prevent a large
   proliferation of specific purpose events (e.g., packets_acknowledged,
   flow_control_updated, stream_data_received).  It has Extra importance
   level; see Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   Implementations have the opportunity to (selectively) log this type
   of signal without having to log packet-level details (e.g., in
   packet_received).  Since for almost all cases, the effects of
   applying a frame to the internal state of an implementation can be
   inferred from that frame's contents, these events are aggregated into
   this single frames_processed event.

   The frame_processed event can be used to signal internal state change
   not resulting directly from the actual "parsing" of a frame (e.g.,
   the frame could have been parsed, data put into a buffer, then later
   processed, then logged with this event).

   The packet_received event can convey all constituent frames.  It is
   not expected that the frames_processed event will also be used for a
   redundant purpose.  Rather, implementations can use this event to
   avoid having to log full packets or to convey extra information about
   when frames are processed (for example, if frame processing is
   deferred for any reason).

   Note that for some events, this approach will lose some information
   (e.g., for which encryption level are packets being acknowledged?).
   If this information is important, the packet_received event can be
   used instead.

   In some implementations, it can be difficult to log frames directly,
   even when using packet_sent and packet_received events.  For these
   cases, the frames_processed event also contains the packet_numbers
   field, which can be used to more explicitly link this event to the
   packet_sent/received events.  The field is an array, which supports
   using a single frames_processed event for multiple frames received
   over multiple packets.  To map between frames and packets, the
   position and order of entries in the frames and packet_numbers is
   used.  If the optional packet_numbers field is used, each frame MUST
   have a corresponding packet number at the same index.

   QUICFramesProcessed = {
       frames: [* $QuicFrame]
       ? packet_numbers: [* uint64]
   }

                 Figure 22: QUICFramesProcessed definition

   For example, an instance of the frames_processed event that
   represents four STREAM frames received over two packets would have
   the fields serialized as:

   "frames":[
     {"frame_type":"stream","stream_id":0,"offset":0,"length":500},
     {"frame_type":"stream","stream_id":0,"offset":500,"length":200},
     {"frame_type":"stream","stream_id":1,"offset":0,"length":300},
     {"frame_type":"stream","stream_id":1,"offset":300,"length":50}
     ],
   "packet_numbers":[
     1,
     1,
     2,
     2
   ]

5.15.  stream_data_moved

   The stream_data_moved event is used to indicate when QUIC stream data
   moves between the different layers.  This helps make clear the flow
   of data, how long data remains in various buffers, and the overheads
   introduced by individual layers.  The event has Base importance
   level; see Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   For example, it can be useful to understand when when data moves from
   an application protocol (e.g., HTTP) to QUIC stream buffers and vice
   versa.  Similarly, when data moves from the application protocol
   layer into a user-facing application such as a web browser.

   The stream_data_moved event can provide insight into whether received
   data on a QUIC stream is moved to the application protocol
   immediately (for example per received packet) or in larger batches
   (for example, all QUIC packets are processed first and afterwards the
   application layer reads from the streams with newly available data).
   This can help identify bottlenecks, flow control issues, or
   scheduling problems.

   This event is only for data in QUIC streams.  For data in QUIC
   Datagram Frames, see the datagram_data_moved event defined in
   Section 5.16.

   QUICStreamDataMoved = {
       ? stream_id: uint64
       ? offset: uint64

       ; byte length of the moved data
       ? length: uint64
       ? from: "user" /
               "application" /
               "transport" /
               "network" /
               text
       ? to: "user" /
             "application" /
             "transport" /
             "network" /
             text
       ? raw: RawInfo
   }

                 Figure 23: QUICStreamDataMoved definition

5.16.  datagram_data_moved

   The datagram_data_moved event is used to indicate when QUIC Datagram
   Frame data (see [RFC9221]) moves between the different layers.  This
   helps make clear the flow of data, how long data remains in various
   buffers, and the overheads introduced by individual layers.  The
   event has Base importance level; see Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   For example, passing from the application protocol (e.g.,
   WebTransport) to QUIC Datagram Frame buffers and vice versa.
   Similarly, when data moves from the application protocol layer into a
   user-facing application such as a web browser.

   The datagram_data_moved event can provide insight into whether
   received data in a QUIC Datagram Frame is moved to the application
   protocol immediately (for example per received packet) or in larger
   batches (for example, all QUIC packets are processed first and
   afterwards the application layer reads all Datagrams at once).  This
   can help identify bottlenecks, flow control issues, or scheduling
   problems.

   This event is only for data in QUIC Datagram Frames.  For data in
   QUIC streams, see the stream_data_moved event defined in
   Section 5.15.

   QUICDatagramDataMoved = {
       ; byte length of the moved data
       ? length: uint64
       ? from: "user" /
               "application" /
               "transport" /
               "network" /
               text
       ? to: "user" /
             "application" /
             "transport" /

       ? raw: RawInfo
   }

6.  Security Events

6.1.  key_updated

   The key_updated event has Base importance level; see Section 9.2 of
   [QLOG-MAIN].

   SecurityKeyUpdated = {
       key_type: KeyType
       ? old: hexstring
       ? new: hexstring

       ; needed for 1RTT key updates
       ? key_phase: uint64
       ? trigger:
           ; (e.g., initial, handshake and 0-RTT keys
           ; are generated by TLS)
           "tls" /
           "remote_update" /
           "local_update"
   }

                  Figure 25: SecurityKeyUpdated definition

   Note that the key_phase is the full value of the key phase (as
   indicated by @M and @N in Figure 9 of [QUIC-TLS]).  The key phase bit
   used on the packet header is the least significant bit of the key
   phase.

6.2.  key_discarded

   The key_discarded event has Base importance level; see Section 9.2 of
   [QLOG-MAIN].

   SecurityKeyDiscarded = {
       key_type: KeyType
       ? key: hexstring

       ; needed for 1RTT key updates
       ? key_phase: uint64
       ? trigger:
           ; (e.g., initial, handshake and 0-RTT keys
           ; are generated by TLS)
           "tls" /
           "remote_update" /
           "local_update"
   }

                 Figure 26: SecurityKeyDiscarded definition

7.  Recovery events

   Most of the events in this category are kept generic to support
   different recovery approaches and various congestion control
   algorithms.  Tool creators SHOULD make an effort to support and
   visualize even unknown data in these events (e.g., plot unknown
   congestion states by name on a timeline visualization).

7.1.  parameters_set

   The parameters_set event groups initial parameters from both loss
   detection and congestion control into a single event.  It has Base
   importance level; see Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   All these settings are typically set once and never change.
   Implementation that do, for some reason, change these parameters
   during execution, MAY emit the parameters_set event more than once.

   RecoveryParametersSet = {

       ; Loss detection, see RFC 9002 Appendix A.2
       ; in amount of packets
       ? reordering_threshold: uint16

       ; as RTT multiplier
       ? time_threshold: float32

       ; in ms
       timer_granularity: uint16

       ; in ms
       ? initial_rtt:float32

       ; congestion control, see RFC 9002 Appendix B.2
       ; in bytes. Note that this could be updated after pmtud
       ? max_datagram_size: uint32

       ; in bytes
       ? initial_congestion_window: uint64

       ; Note that this could change when max_datagram_size changes
       ; in bytes
       ? minimum_congestion_window: uint64
       ? loss_reduction_factor: float32

       ; as PTO multiplier
       ? persistent_congestion_threshold: uint16
   }

                Figure 27: RecoveryParametersSet definition

   Additionally, this event can contain any number of unspecified fields
   to support different recovery approaches.

7.2.  metrics_updated

   The metrics_updated event is emitted when one or more of the
   observable recovery metrics changes value.  It has Core importance
   level; see Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   This event SHOULD group all possible metric updates that happen at or
   around the same time in a single event (e.g., if min_rtt and
   smoothed_rtt change at the same time, they should be bundled in a
   single metrics_updated entry, rather than split out into two).
   Consequently, a metrics_updated event is only guaranteed to contain
   at least one of the listed metrics.

   RecoveryMetricsUpdated = {

       ; Loss detection, see RFC 9002 Appendix A.3
       ; all following rtt fields are expressed in ms
       ? min_rtt: float32
       ? smoothed_rtt: float32
       ? latest_rtt: float32
       ? rtt_variance: float32
       ? pto_count: uint16

       ; Congestion control, see RFC 9002 Appendix B.2.
       ; in bytes
       ? congestion_window: uint64
       ? bytes_in_flight: uint64

       ; in bytes
       ? ssthresh: uint64

       ; qlog defined
       ; sum of all packet number spaces
       ? packets_in_flight: uint64

       ; in bits per second
       ? pacing_rate: uint64
   }

                Figure 28: RecoveryMetricsUpdated definition

   In order to make logging easier, implementations MAY log values even
   if they are the same as previously reported values (e.g., two
   subsequent RecoveryMetricsUpdated entries can both report the exact
   same value for min_rtt).  However, applications SHOULD try to log
   only actual updates to values.

   Additionally, the metrics_updated event can contain any number of
   unspecified fields to support different recovery approaches.

7.3.  congestion_state_updated

   The congestion_state_updated event signifies when the congestion
   controller enters a significant new state and changes its behaviour.
   It has Base importance level; see Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   The event is generic to support different Congestion Control
   algorithms.  For example, for the algorithm defined in the Recovery
   draft ("enhanced" New Reno), the following states are defined:

   *  slow_start

   *  congestion_avoidance

   *  application_limited

   *  recovery

   RecoveryCongestionStateUpdated = {
       ? old: text
       new: text
       ? trigger:
           "persistent_congestion" /
           "ECN"
   }

            Figure 29: RecoveryCongestionStateUpdated definition

   The trigger field SHOULD be logged if there are multiple ways in
   which a state change can occur but MAY be omitted if a given state
   can only be due to a single event occurring (e.g., slow start is
   exited only when ssthresh is exceeded).

7.4.  loss_timer_updated

   The loss_timer_updated event is emitted when a recovery loss timer
   changes state.  It has Extra importance level; see Section 9.2 of
   [QLOG-MAIN].

   The three main event types are:

   *  set: the timer is set with a delta timeout for when it will
      trigger next

   *  expired: when the timer effectively expires after the delta
      timeout

   *  cancelled: when a timer is cancelled (e.g., all outstanding
      packets are acknowledged, start idle period)

   In order to indicate an active timer's timeout update, a new set
   event is used.

   RecoveryLossTimerUpdated = {

       ; called "mode" in RFC 9002 A.9.
       ? timer_type: "ack" /
                     "pto"
       ? packet_number_space: PacketNumberSpace
       event_type: "set" /
                   "expired" /
                   "cancelled"

       ; if event_type === "set": delta time is in ms from
       ; this event's timestamp until when the timer will trigger
       ? delta: float32
   }

               Figure 30: RecoveryLossTimerUpdated definition

7.5.  packet_lost

   The packet_lost event is emitted when a packet is deemed lost by loss
   detection.  It has Core importance level; see Section 9.2 of
   [QLOG-MAIN].

   It is RECOMMENDED to populate the optional trigger field in order to
   help disambiguate among the various possible causes of a loss
   declaration.

   RecoveryPacketLost = {

       ; should include at least the packet_type and packet_number
       ? header: PacketHeader

       ; not all implementations will keep track of full
       ; packets, so these are optional
       ? frames: [* $QuicFrame]
       ? is_mtu_probe_packet: bool .default false
       ? trigger:
           "reordering_threshold" /
           "time_threshold" /
           ; RFC 9002 Section 6.2.4 paragraph 6, MAY
           "pto_expired"
   }

                  Figure 31: RecoveryPacketLost definition

7.6.  marked_for_retransmit

   The marked_for_retransmit event indicates which data was marked for
   retransmission upon detection of packet loss (see packet_lost).  It
   has Extra importance level; see Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   Similar to the reasoning for the frames_processed event, in order to
   keep the amount of different events low, this signal is grouped into
   in a single event based on existing QUIC frame definitions for all
   types of retransmittable data.

   Implementations retransmitting full packets or frames directly can
   just log the constituent frames of the lost packet here (or do away
   with this event and use the contents of the packet_lost event
   instead).  Conversely, implementations that have more complex logic
   (e.g., marking ranges in a stream's data buffer as in-flight), or
   that do not track sent frames in full (e.g., only stream offset +
   length), can translate their internal behaviour into the appropriate
   frame instance here even if that frame was never or will never be put
   on the wire.

   Much of this data can be inferred if implementations log packet_sent
   events (e.g., looking at overlapping stream data offsets and length,
   one can determine when data was retransmitted).

   RecoveryMarkedForRetransmit = {
       frames: [+ $QuicFrame]
   }

             Figure 32: RecoveryMarkedForRetransmit definition

7.7.  ecn_state_updated

   The ecn_state_updated event indicates a progression in the ECN state
   machine as described in section A.4 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  It has
   Extra importance level; see Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   ECNStateUpdated = {
      ? old: ECNState
       new: ECNState
   }

   ECNState =
     ; ECN testing in progress
     "testing" /
     ; ECN state unknown, waiting for acknowledgements
     ; for testing packets
     "unknown" /
     ; ECN testing failed
     "failed" /
     ; testing was successful, the endpoint now
     ; sends packets with ECT(0) marking
     "capable"

   The token carried in an Initial packet can either be a retry token
   from a Retry packet, or one originally provided by the server in a
   NEW_TOKEN frame used when resuming a connection (e.g., for address
   validation purposes).  Retry and resumption tokens typically contain

   this metadata and its format is implementation specific.  For that,
   Token includes a general-purpose details field.

8.12.  QUIC Frames

   The generic $QuicFrame is defined here as a CDDL extension point (a
   "socket" or "plug").  It can be extended to support additional QUIC
   frame types.

   ; The QuicFrame is any key-value map (e.g., JSON object)
   $QuicFrame /= {
       * text => any
   }

                    Figure 46: QuicFrame plug definition

   The QUIC frame types defined in this document are as follows:

   QuicBaseFrames /= PaddingFrame /
                     PingFrame /
                     AckFrame /

8.12.1.  PaddingFrame

   In QUIC, PADDING frames are simply identified as a single byte of
   value 0.  As such, each padding byte could be theoretically
   interpreted and logged as an individual PaddingFrame.

   However, as this leads to heavy logging overhead, implementations
   SHOULD instead emit just a single PaddingFrame and set the
   payload_length property to the amount of PADDING bytes/frames
   included in the packet.

   PaddingFrame = {
       frame_type: "padding"

       ; total frame length, including frame header
       ? length: uint32
       payload_length: uint32
   }

                     Figure 48: PaddingFrame definition

8.12.2.  PingFrame

   PingFrame = {
       frame_type: "ping"

       ; total frame length, including frame header
       ? length: uint32
       ? payload_length: uint32
   }

                      Figure 49: PingFrame definition

8.12.3.  AckFrame

   ; either a single number (e.g., [1]) or two numbers (e.g., [1,2]).
   ; For two numbers:
   ; the first number is "from": lowest packet number in interval
   ; the second number is "to": up to and including the highest
   ; packet number in the interval
   AckRange = [1*2 uint64]

   AckFrame = {
       frame_type: "ack"

       ; in ms
       ? ack_delay: float32

       ; e.g., looks like [[1,2],[4,5], [7], [10,22]] serialized
       ? acked_ranges: [+ AckRange]

       ; ECN (explicit congestion notification) related fields
       ; (not always present)
       ? ect1: uint64
       ? ect0: uint64
       ? ce: uint64

       ; total frame length, including frame header
       ? length: uint32
       ? payload_length: uint32
   }

                       Figure 50: AckFrame definition

   Note that the packet ranges in AckFrame.acked_ranges do not
   necessarily have to be ordered (e.g., [[5,9],[1,4]] is a valid
   value).

   Note that the two numbers in the packet range can be the same (e.g.,
   [120,120] means that packet with number 120 was ACKed).  However, in
   that case, implementers SHOULD log [120] instead and tools MUST be
   able to deal with both notations.

8.12.4.  ResetStreamFrame

   ResetStreamFrame = {
       frame_type: "reset_stream"

8.12.19.  ConnectionCloseFrame

   An endpoint that receives unknown error codes can record it in the
   error_code field using the numerical value without variable-length
   integer encoding.

   When the connection is closed due a connection-level error, the
   trigger_frame_type field can be used to log the frame that triggered
   the error.  For known frame types, the appropriate string value is
   used.  For unknown frame types, the numerical value without variable-
   length integer encoding is used.

   ErrorSpace = "transport" /
                "application"

   ConnectionCloseFrame = {
       frame_type: "connection_close"
       ? error_space: ErrorSpace
       ? error_code: TransportError /
                     CryptoError /
                     $ApplicationError /
                     uint64
       ? reason: text

       ; when error_space === "transport"
       ? trigger_frame_type: uint64 /

   HandshakeDoneFrame = {
     frame_type: "handshake_done";
   }

                  Figure 67: HandshakeDoneFrame definition

8.12.21.  UnknownFrame

   The frame_type_value field is the numerical value without VLIE
   encoding.

   UnknownFrame = {
       frame_type: "unknown"
       frame_type_value: uint64
       ? raw: RawInfo
   }

                     Figure 68: UnknownFrame definition

8.12.22.  DatagramFrame

   The QUIC DATAGRAM frame is defined in Section 4 of [RFC9221].

   DatagramFrame = {
       frame_type: "datagram"
       ? length: uint64
       ? raw: RawInfo
   }

                    "connection_refused" /
                    "flow_control_error" /

                    "transport_parameter_error" /
                    "connection_id_limit_error" /
                    "protocol_violation" /
                    "invalid_token" /
                    "application_error" /
                    "crypto_buffer_exceeded" /
                    "key_update_error" /
                    "aead_limit_reached" /
                    "no_viable_path"
                    ; there is no value to reflect CRYPTO_ERROR
                    ; use the CryptoError type instead

                    Figure 70: TransportError definition

8.12.24.  ApplicationError

   By definition, an application error is defined by the application-
   level protocol running on top of QUIC (e.g., HTTP/3).

   As such, it cannot be defined here directly.  Applications MAY use
   the provided extension point through the use of the CDDL "socket"
   mechanism.

   Application-level qlog definitions that wish to define new
   ApplicationError strings MUST do so by extending the
   $ApplicationError socket as such:

   $ApplicationError /= "new_error_name" /
                        "another_new_error_name"

8.12.25.  CryptoError

   These errors are defined in the TLS document as "A TLS alert is
   turned into a QUIC connection error by converting the one-byte alert
   description into a QUIC error code.  The alert description is added
   to 0x100 to produce a QUIC error code from the range reserved for
   CRYPTO_ERROR."

   This approach maps badly to a pre-defined enum.  As such, the
   crypto_error string is defined as having a dynamic component here,
   which should include the hex-encoded and zero-padded value of the TLS
   alert description.

   ; all strings from "crypto_error_0x100" to "crypto_error_0x1ff"
   CryptoError = text .regexp "crypto_error_0x1[0-9a-f][0-9a-f]"

                     Figure 71: CryptoError definition

   *  Added parameters_restored events to help clarify 0-RTT behaviour
      (#88)

   Smaller changes:

   *  Merged loss_timer events into one loss_timer_updated event

   *  Field data types are now strongly defined (#10,#39,#36,#115)

   *  Renamed qpack instruction_received and instruction_sent to
      instruction_created and instruction_parsed (#114)

   *  Updated qpack:dynamic_table_updated.update_type.  It now has the
      value "inserted" instead of "added" (#113)

   *  Updated qpack:dynamic_table_updated.  It now has an "owner" field
      to differentiate encoder vs decoder state (#112)

   *  Removed push_allowed from http:parameters_set (#110)

   *  Removed explicit trigger field indications from events, since this
      was moved to be a generic property of the "data" field (#80)

   *  Updated transport:connection_id_updated to be more in line with
      other similar events.  Also dropped importance from Core to Base
      (#45)

   *  Added length property to PaddingFrame (#34)

   *  Added packet_number field to transport:frames_processed (#74)

   *  Added a way to generically log packet header flags (first 8 bits)
      to PacketHeader

   *  Added additional guidance on which events to log in which
      situations (#53)

   *  Added "simulation:scenario" event to help indicate simulation
      details

   *  Added "packets_acked" event (#107)

   *  Added "datagram_ids" to the datagram_X and packet_X events to
      allow tracking of coalesced QUIC packets (#91)

   *  Extended connection_state_updated with more fine-grained states
      (#49)

Since draft-marx-qlog-event-definitions-quic-h3-00:

   *  Event and category names are now all lowercase

   *  Added many new events and their definitions

   *  "type" fields have been made more specific (especially important
      for PacketType fields, which are now called packet_type instead of
      type)

   *  Events are given an importance indicator (issue #22)

   *  Event names are more consistent and use past tense (issue #21)

   *  Triggers have been redefined as properties of the "data" field and
      updated for most events (issue #23)
